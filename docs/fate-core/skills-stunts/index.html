<h2 id="defining-skills">Defining Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>skill</strong> is a word that describes a broad family of competency at<br />
something—such as <a href="../../fate-core/athletics">Athletics</a>, <a href="../../fate-core/fight">Fight<br />
</a>, or <a href="../../fate-
core/deceive">Deceive</a>—which your character might have gained through innate talent,<br />
training, or years of trial and error. Skills are the basis for everything<br />
your character actually does in the game that involves challenge and chance<br />
(and dice).</p>
<p>Skills are rated on the adjective <a href="../../fate-core/taking-
action-dice-ladder" title="The Ladder">ladder</a>. The higher the rating, the better your<br />
character is at the skill. Taken together, your list of skills gives you a<br />
picture of that character’s potential for action at a glance—what you’re best<br />
at, what you’re okay at, and what you’re not so good at.</p>
<p>We define skills in two ways in Fate—in terms of the <em>game actions</em> that you<br />
can do with them, and the <em>context</em> in which you can use them. There are only<br />
a handful of basic game actions, but the number of potential contexts is<br />
infinite.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-game-actions">The Basic Game Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#the-basic-game-actions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>We cover these in more detail in <a href="../../fate-
core/actions-outcomes" title="Actions &amp; Outcomes">Actions and Outcomes</a>, but here’s a quick reference so<br />
that you don’t have to flip all the way over there right now.</p>
<p><strong>Overcome:</strong> True to its name, you tackle some kind of challenge, engaging task, or hindrance related to your skill.</p>
<p><strong>Create an Advantage:</strong> Whether you’re discovering something that already exists about an opponent or creating a situation that helps you succeed, creating advantages allows you to discover and create aspects, and lets you get free invocations of them.</p>
<p><strong>Attack:</strong> You try to harm someone in a conflict. That harm may be physical, mental, emotional, or social in nature.</p>
<p><strong>Defend:</strong> You try to keep someone from harming you, getting past you, or creating an advantage to use against you.</p>
<p>There are also some special effects that some skills perform, such as giving<br />
you additional <a href="../../fate-core/stress-consequences">stress</a> boxes<br />
for a conflict. See <a href="../../fate-core/physique">Physique</a> and <a href="../../fate-core/will">Will<br />
</a> in the default skill list below for examples.</p>
<p>Even though there are only four actions that all skills adhere to, the skill<br />
in question lends context to the action. For example, both Burglary and Crafts<br />
allow you to create an advantage, but only under very different<br />
contexts—Burglary allows you to do it when you’re casing a place you’re about<br />
to break into, and Crafts allows you to do it when you’re examining a piece of<br />
machinery. The different skills let you differentiate the PCs’ abilities from<br />
one another a bit, allowing each person to have a unique contribution to the<br />
game.</p>
<h2 id="defining-stunts">Defining Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A stunt is a special trait your character has that changes the way a skill<br />
works for you. Stunts indicate some special, privileged way a character uses a<br />
skill that is unique to whoever has that stunt, which is a pretty common trope<br />
in a lot of settings—special or elite training, exceptional talents, the mark<br />
of destiny, genetic alteration, innate coolness, and a myriad of other reasons<br />
all explain why some people get more out of their skills than others do.</p>
<p>Unlike skills, which are about the sort of things anyone can do in your<br />
campaign, stunts are about individual characters. For that reason, the next<br />
several pages are about how to make your own stunts, but we’ll also have<br />
example stunts listed under each skill in the <a href="../../fate-core/default-skill-list" title="Default Skill List">Default Skill List</a>.</p>
<p>Having stunts in your game allows you to differentiate characters that have<br />
the same skills as one another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landon and Cynere both have a high Fight skill, but Cynere also has the<br />
Warmaster stunt, which makes her better at creating advantages with the skill.<br />
This differentiates the two characters a great deal—Cynere has a unique<br />
capability to analyze and understand her enemies’ weaknesses in a way Landon<br />
doesn’t.</p>
<p>One might imagine Cynere starting a fight by testing an enemy with moves and<br />
jabs, carefully assessing her opponent’s limits before moving in for a<br />
decisive strike, whereas Landon is happy to wade in and chop away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use this to set apart a certain set of abilities as belonging to<br />
a dedicated few, if that’s something your setting needs. For example, in a<br />
contemporary setting, you might feel that there shouldn’t be a base skill that<br />
allows just anyone to have medical training. (Unless, of course, it’s a game<br />
about doctors.) However, as a stunt for another, more general knowledge skill<br />
(like Lore), you can have one character be “the doctor” if that’s what the<br />
player wants.</p>
<h2 id="stunts-and-refresh">Stunts and Refresh<a class="headerlink" href="#stunts-and-refresh" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Taking a new stunt beyond the first three reduces your character’s refresh<br />
rate by one.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble coming up with a stunt, give the <a href="../../stunt-maker/">Stuntmaker</a> a go. It will generate random stunts to inspire you!<br />
(Just be sure to vet them with the table before using them.)</p>
