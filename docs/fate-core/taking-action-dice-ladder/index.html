<p>Players, some of the things you’ll do in a Fate game require you to <strong>roll<br />
dice to see if your character succeeds or not. You will always roll the dice<br />
when you’re opposing another character with your efforts, or when there’s a<br />
significant obstacle in the way of your effort.</strong> Otherwise, just say what<br />
your character does and assume it happens.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span>To overcome an <a href="../../fate-core
/four-actions#overcome">obstacle</a></p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span>To create or unlock an advantage for your character,<br />
in the form of an [aspect you can use](../../fate-core/four-actions</p>
<h1 id="create-an-advantage">create-an-advantage)<a class="headerlink" href="#create-an-advantage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span>To attack someone in a <a href="../../fate-
core/four-actions#attack">conflict</a></p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span>To defend yourself in a <a href="../..
/fate-core/four-actions#defend">conflict</a></p>
<h2 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice<a class="headerlink" href="#rolling-the-dice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When you need to roll dice in Fate, pick up four Fate dice and roll them. When<br />
you read the dice, read every <span class="fate_font">+</span> as +1, every<br />
<span class="fate_font">0</span> as 0, and every <span class="fate_font">-</span> as –1. Add<br />
them all together. You’ll get a result from –4 to +4, most often between –2<br />
and +2.</p>
<p>Here are some sample dice totals:</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">-+0+</span> = +1<br />
<span class="fate_font">+-00</span> =<br />
<span class="fate_font">+++-</span> = +2<br />
<span class="fate_font">-000</span> = −1</p>
<p>The result on the dice isn’t your final total, however. If your character has<br />
a skill that’s appropriate to the action, you get to add your character’s<br />
rating in that skill to whatever you rolled.</p>
<p>So, once you’ve rolled the dice, how do you determine what a particular result<br />
means? Glad you asked.</p>

<h2 id="the-ladder">The Ladder<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ladder" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Fate uses a ladder of adjectives and numbers to rate the dice results, a<br />
character’s skills and the result of a roll.Here’s the ladder:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>+8</th>
<th>Legendary</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>+7</td>
<td>Epic</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+6</td>
<td>Fantastic</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+5</td>
<td>Superb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+4</td>
<td>Great</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+3</td>
<td>Good</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+2</td>
<td>Fair</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+1</td>
<td>Average</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+0</td>
<td>Mediocre</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>Poor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-2</td>
<td>Terrible</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It doesn’t really matter which side of the ladder you use—some people remember<br />
the words better, some people remember the numbers better, and some people<br />
like using both. So you could say, “I got a Great,” or “I got a +4,” and it<br />
means the same thing. As long as everyone understands what you’re<br />
communicating, you’re fine.</p>
<p>Results can go below and above the ladder. It is encouraged that you to come<br />
up with your own names for results above Legendary, such as “Zounds!” and<br />
“Ridiculously Awesome.”</p>
<h2 id="interpreting-results">Interpreting Results<a class="headerlink" href="#interpreting-results" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When you roll the dice, you’re trying to get a high enough roll to match or<br />
beat your opposition. That opposition is going to come in one of two forms:<br />
<strong>active opposition</strong>, from someone rolling dice against you, or <strong>passive<br />
opposition</strong>, from an obstacle that just has a set rating on the ladder for<br />
you to overcome. (GMs, you can also just decide your NPCs give passive<br />
opposition when you don’t want to roll dice for them.)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if you beat your opposition on the ladder, you succeed at<br />
your <a href="../../fate-core/four-actions">action</a>. A tie creates some<br />
effect, but not to the extent your character was intending. If you win by a<br />
lot, something extra happens (like doing more harm to your opponent in a<br />
fight).</p>
<p>If you don’t beat the opposition, either you don’t succeed at your action, you<br />
succeed at a cost, or something else happens to complicate the <a href="../../fate-core/four-outcomes">outcome<br />
</a>. Some game actions have special<br />
results when you fail at the roll.</p>
<p>When you beat a roll or a set obstacle, the difference between your opposition<br />
and your result is what is called shifts. When you roll equal to the<br />
opposition, you have zero shifts. Roll one over your opposition, and you have<br />
one shift. Two over means two shifts, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landon is trying to escape an ancient mechanical death trap he accidentally<br />
set off during a “routine” exploration of the Anthari Catacombs. Dozens of<br />
tiny (and some not-so-tiny) spears are shooting out of the walls in a certain<br />
hallway, and he needs to get past them to the other side.</p>
<p>Amanda, the GM, says, “This is passive opposition, because it’s just a trap<br />
in your way. It’s opposing you at Great (+4). The Anthari really didn’t want<br />
anyone getting to their temple treasure.”</p>
<p>Lenny sighs and says, “Well, I’ve got Athletics at Good (+3), so I’ll try<br />
dodging and weaving through them to cross the hall.”</p>
<p>He takes up the dice and rolls, getting <span class="fate_font">-+++</span>, for a<br />
result of +2. This steps up his result on the ladder by two, from Good (+3) to<br />
Superb (+5). That’s enough to beat the opposition by one shift and succeed.</p>
<p>Amanda says, “Well, it takes equal parts acrobatics and frantic stumbling,<br />
but you manage to make it through to the other side with only some cosmetic<br />
tears in your tunic to show for it. The mechanism shows no sign of stopping,<br />
though—you’ll still have to deal with it on your way out.”</p>
<p>Lenny replies, “Just another day at the office,” and Landon continues his<br />
trek through the catacombs.</p>
