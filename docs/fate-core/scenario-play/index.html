<p>So, now you should be ready to begin: you have a problem that can’t be<br />
ignored, a variety of story questions that will lead to resolving that problem<br />
one way or another, a core group of NPCs and their motivations, and a really<br />
dynamic first scene that will get things cooking.</p>
<p>Everything should be smooth sailing from here, right? You present the<br />
questions, the players gradually answer them, and your story rolls into a<br />
nice, neat conclusion.</p>
<p>Yeah... trust us, it’ll never happen that way.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when you actually get the scenario off<br />
the ground is this: whatever happens will always be different from what you<br />
expect. The PCs will hate an NPC you intended them to befriend, have wild<br />
successes that give away a bad guy’s secrets very early, suffer unexpected<br />
setbacks that change the course of their actions, or any one of another<br />
hundred different things that just don’t end up the way you think they should.</p>
<p>Notice that we don’t recommend predetermining what scenes and locations are<br />
going to be involved in your scenario—that’s because we find that most of the<br />
time, you’re going to throw out most of that material anyway, in the face of a<br />
dynamic group of players and their choices.</p>
<p>Not all is lost, however—the stuff you have prepared should help you<br />
tremendously when players do something unexpected. Your story questions are<br />
vague enough that there are going to be multiple ways to answer each one, and<br />
you can very quickly axe one that isn’t going to be relevant and replace it<br />
with something else on the fly without having to toss the rest of your work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda had expected that the scene with Landon, Cynere, and Anna would<br />
result in a briefly violent reaction, thanks to Landon, followed by the PCs<br />
explaining that they’re not with the Cult of Tranquility and everyone<br />
realizing that they’re all on the same side.</p>
<p>Right? No.</p>
<p>The first swing of Landon’s sword fells Anna where she stands, killing what<br />
would’ve been their first contact with the Sun and Moon Society, an important<br />
secret organization opposing the cult. Plus, Anna’s companions are now<br />
convinced that he and Cynere are indeed cultists.</p>
<p>So...slight detour. Amanda sees a few ways to go from here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The warriors throw caution to the wind, cry “Revenge!” and fight to the<br />
death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the warriors assumes Anna’s role in the scene and continues the<br />
conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The warriors flee (making a concession) and report the killing to their<br />
superiors in the secret society, leaving Anna’s body behind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She decides to go with the third option. These two may be good guys, but<br />
they’re not heroes, and neither one of them is up for taking on Landon after<br />
that opener. And the odds of them wanting to have a little chat with Anna’s<br />
corpse at their feet are, at best, slim.</p>
<p>Plus, Amanda figures Lily and Lenny will want to search the body, which<br />
would present a good opportunity to feed them information about the Sun and<br />
Moon Society. It’s also a way to bring Zird in on the action—maybe he knows<br />
something about the Sun and Moon Society already, and can make contact with<br />
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, knowing your NPCs’ motivations and goals allows you to adjust their<br />
behavior more easily than if you’d just placed them in a static scene waiting<br />
for the PCs to show up. When the players throw you a curveball, make the NPCs<br />
as dynamic and reactive as they are, by having them take sudden, surprising<br />
action in pursuit of their goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda’s still stuck on Anna’s unexpected demise. She’d planned on making<br />
her an entry point for a whole story arc—maybe not a powerful NPC, but a<br />
pretty important one nonetheless. So if Anna’s not going to be around anymore,<br />
Amanda at least wants to make something out of her death.</p>
<p>She decides that, while the death of a member of the Sun and Moon Society<br />
would go unnoticed by most of Riverton, a guy like Hugo the Charitable would<br />
certainly hear about it. He’d already taken notice of Landon after he fought<br />
off a few Scar Triad goons. And now this. This newcomer is clearly dangerous,<br />
potentially a threat. Worst, he doesn’t seem to be working for anyone.</p>
<p>Given Hugo’s high concept aspect of Everyone in Riverton Fears Me, he sees<br />
Landon as a potential asset for the Scar Triad. If you can’t beat ‘em, recruit<br />
‘em.</p>

<p>A scenario ends when you’ve run enough scenes to definitively answer most of<br />
the story questions you came up with when you were preparing your scenario.<br />
Sometimes you’ll be able to do that in a single session if you have a lot of<br />
time or only a few questions. If you have a lot of questions, it’ll probably<br />
take you two or three sessions to get through them all.</p>
<p>Don’t feel the need to answer every story question if you’ve brought things to<br />
a satisfying conclusion—you can either use unresolved story questions for<br />
future scenarios or let them lie if they didn’t get a whole lot of traction<br />
with the players.</p>
<p>The end of a scenario usually triggers a significant milestone. When this<br />
happens, you should also see if the game <a href="../../fate-core/world-advancement" title="World Advancement">world needs advancing</a> too.</p>
