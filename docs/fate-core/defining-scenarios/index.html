<p>As mentioned in Running the Game, a scenario is a unit of game time usually<br />
lasting from one to four sessions, and made up of a number of discrete scenes.<br />
The end of a scenario should trigger a significant milestone, allowing your<br />
PCs to get better at what they do.</p>
<p>In a scenario, the PCs are going to face and try to resolve some kind of big,<br />
urgent, open-ended problem (or problems). The GM will typically open a<br />
scenario by presenting this problem to the players, with subsequent scenes<br />
revolving around what the PCs do to deal with it, whether that’s researching<br />
information, gathering resources, or striking directly at the problem’s<br />
source.</p>
<p>Along the way, you’ll also have some NPCs who are opposed to the PCs’ goals<br />
interfere with their attempts to solve the problem. These could be your<br />
Raymond Chandler-esque “two guys with guns” bursting through the door to kill<br />
them, or simply someone with different interests who wants to negotiate with<br />
the PCs in order to get them to deal with the problem in a different way.</p>
<p>The best scenarios don’t have one particular “right” ending. Maybe the PCs<br />
don’t resolve the problem, or resolve it in such a way that it has bad<br />
repercussions. Maybe they succeed with flying colors. Maybe they circumvent<br />
the problem, or change the situation in order to minimize the impact of the<br />
problem. You won’t know until you play.</p>
<p>Once the problem is resolved (or it can no longer be resolved), the scenario<br />
is over. The following session, you’ll start a new scenario, which can either<br />
relate directly to the previous scenario or present a whole new problem.</p>
