    <p>Fate Core</p>
<h1 id="physique">Physique<a class="headerlink" href="#physique" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The Physique skill is a counterpart to Athletics, representing the character’s<br />
natural physical aptitudes, such as raw strength and endurance. In our example<br />
game, we have this skill broken out as something separate in order to create<br />
two distinct types of physical characters—the nimble guy (represented by<br />
Athletics) and the strongman (represented by Physique).</p>
<p>In your game, you might not find this distinction necessary to make with<br />
separate skills—though you might still let players make that distinction with<br />
stunts and aspects.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: You can use Physique to <a href="../../fate-core/four-actions">overcome any<br />
obstacles</a> that require the application<br />
of brute force—most often to overcome a situation aspect on a zone—or any<br />
other physical impedance, like prison bars or locked gates. Of course,<br />
Physique is the classic skill for arm-wrestling matches and <a href="../../fate-core/contests">other contests<br />
</a> of applied strength, as well as marathons<br />
or other endurance-based <a href="../../fate-core/challenges">challenges</a>.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: Physique has a lot of<br />
potential for advantages in physical conflict, usually related to grappling<br />
and holding someone in place, making them Pinned or Locked Down. You might<br />
also use it as a way of discovering physical impairments possessed by the<br />
target—grappling the old mercenary tells you that he has a Bum Leg or some<br />
such.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Physique is not used to harm people<br />
directly—see the <a href="../../fate-core/fight">Fight</a> skill for that.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Though you don’t generally use Physique to<br />
defend against attacks, you can use it to provide active opposition to someone<br />
else’s movement, provided you’re in a small enough space that you can<br />
effectively use your body to block access. You might also interpose something<br />
heavy and brace it to stop someone from getting through.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: The Physique skill gives you additional physical <a href="../../fate-core/stress-consequences">stress or consequence slots</a>. Average (+1) or Fair (+2) gives you a 3-point stress box. Good (+3) or Great (+4) gives you a 3-point and a 4-point stress box. Superb (+5)and above give you an additional mild consequence slot along with the additional stress boxes. This slot can only be used for physical harm.</p>
<h2 id="physique-stunts">Physique Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#physique-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grappler</strong>. +2 to Physique rolls made to create advantages on an enemy by wrestling or grappling with them.</li>
<li><strong>Take the Blow</strong>. You can use Physique to defend against Fight attacks made with fists or blunt instruments, though you always take 1 shift of stress on a tie.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tough as Nails</strong>. Once per session, at the cost of a fate point, you can reduce the severity of a moderate consequence that’s physical in nature to a mild consequence (if your mild consequence slot is free), or erase a mild consequence altogether.</p>
