<p>Again, the easiest way to do this is not to bother—just let your scenarios and<br />
arcs emergently create a story for the campaign. Human beings are pattern-<br />
making machines, and it’s very likely that you’ll naturally pick up on what<br />
the long-term plot devices of your campaign need to be by keying into<br />
unanswered questions from the arcs and scenarios.</p>
<p>However, if you want to do a little bit of focused planning, the advice is the<br />
same as for arcs, except you’re generalizing even more. Pick one story<br />
question to answer, which the PCs will spend their scenarios and arcs building<br />
to. Then, jot down some notes on what steps will lead to answering that<br />
question, so you have material for arcs and scenarios.</p>
<p>The very best aspects to look at for a campaign-level problem are your<br />
setting’s current or impending issues, because of their scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda knows that her campaign will hinge on resolving <span class="aspect">The Doom<br />
that Is to Come</span>. So the story question following from that is pretty<br />
obvious. “Can the PCs avert, prevent, or mitigate the prophesied doom?”</p>
<p>She knows that to do that, they’re first going to need to figure out which<br />
of the Cult of Tranquility’s factions is right about the prophecy (if either).<br />
They’ll also need to make sure that none of their personal enemies or The Scar<br />
Triad can interfere with whatever they need to do in order to stop the doom.<br />
That gives her a good idea of what arcs are going to make up the campaign.</p>
