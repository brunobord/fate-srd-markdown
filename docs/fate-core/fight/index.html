    <p>Fate Core</p>
<h1 id="fight">Fight<a class="headerlink" href="#fight" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The Fight skill covers all forms of close-quarters combat (in other words,<br />
within the same zone), both unarmed and using weapons. For the ranged weapons<br />
counterpart, see <a href="../../fate-core/shoot">Shoot</a>.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: Since you don’t really use Fight outside<br />
of a conflict, it’s not often used to overcome obstacles. You might use it to<br />
display your fighting prowess in a demonstration, or to participate in some<br />
kind of regulated bout or sport fighting, which would allow you to use this<br />
skill in a contest.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: You’ll probably use Fight<br />
for most of the advantages you create in a <a href="../..
/fate-core/conflicts">physical conflict</a>. Any number of special moves can be covered with<br />
advantages: a targeted strike to stun, a “dirty move,” disarming, and so on.<br />
You could even use Fight to assess another fighter’s style, spotting<br />
weaknesses in his or her form that you can exploit.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: This is self-explanatory. You make<br />
physical attacks with Fight. Remember, this is for close-in work, so you have<br />
to be in the same <a href="../../fate-core/conflicts">zone</a> as your opponent</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: You use Fight to defend against any other<br />
attack or create an advantage attempt made with Fight, as well as pretty much<br />
any action where violently interposing yourself could prevent it from<br />
happening. You can’t use this skill to defend against Shoot attacks, unless<br />
the setting is fantastical enough that you can catch missiles or swat them<br />
from the air or use laser swords to deflect blasters.</p>
<h2 id="fight-stunts">Fight Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#fight-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Hitter</strong>. When you succeed with style on a Fight attack and choose to reduce the result by one to gain a boost, you gain a full situation aspect with a free invocation instead.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Weapon</strong>. Whenever someone’s about to hit you with a <em>Disarmed</em> situation aspect or something similar, spend a fate point to declare you have a backup weapon. Instead of a situation aspect, your opponent gets a boost, representing the momentary distraction you suffer having to switch.</li>
<li><strong>Killing Stroke</strong>. Once per scene, when you force an opponent to take a consequence, you can spend a fate point to increase the consequence’s severity (so mild becomes moderate, moderate becomes severe). If your opponent was already going to take a severe consequence, he must either take a severe consequence and a second consequence or be taken out.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-art-s-of-fighting">The Art(s) of Fighting<a class="headerlink" href="#the-art-s-of-fighting" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It’s a given that most games that you play with Fate will feature a decent<br />
amount of action and physical conflict. This is another area of emphasis, like<br />
with the Crafts skill, where the skills you choose to have for combat speak<br />
volumes on what your game’s about.</p>
<p>In the examples, we’ve got Fight and Shoot as separate skills, to give us a<br />
basic division without getting too much into minutiae. Notably, though, this<br />
suggests that fighting with a weapon and fighting bare-handed are pretty much<br />
the same—there’s no inherent advantage in doing one over the other. It’s a<br />
pretty common choice to further separate unarmed and armed melee—into Fists<br />
and Weapons, for example.</p>
<p>You could specialize even further if you wanted different classes of weapons<br />
to have their own skills (Swords, Polearms, Axes, Plasma Guns, Slugthrowers,<br />
etc.), but again, we recommend you not go too crazy with this unless it’s<br />
really important to your setting. Specialized weapon use can also be modeled<br />
by using <a href="../../fate-core/extras">extras</a>.</p>
