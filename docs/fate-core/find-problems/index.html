<h1 id="find-problems">Find Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#find-problems" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Creating a scenario begins with finding a problem for the PCs to deal with. A<br />
good problem is <strong>relevant to the PCs, cannot be resolved without their<br />
involvement, and cannot be ignored without dire consequences.</strong></p>
<p>That may seem like a tall order. Fortunately, you have a great storytelling<br />
tool to help you figure out appropriate problems for your game: aspects.</p>
<p>Your PCs’ aspects have a lot of story built into them—they’re an indication of<br />
what’s important about (and to) each character, they indicate what things in<br />
the game world the PCs are connected to, and they describe the unique facets<br />
of each character’s identity.</p>
<p>You also have the aspects that are attached to your game—all your current and<br />
impending issues, location aspects, and any aspects you’ve put on any of your<br />
campaign’s faces. Riffing off of those helps to reinforce the sense of a<br />
consistent, dynamic world, and keep your game’s central premise in the<br />
forefront of play.</p>
<p>Because of all these aspects, you already have a ton of story potential<br />
sitting right in front of you—now, you just have to unlock it.</p>
<p>You can look at an aspect-related problem as a very large-scale kind of <a href="../../fate-core/invoking-compelling-aspects" title="Invoking &amp;
Compelling Aspects">event<br />
compel</a>. The setup is a little more work, but the structure is<br />
similar—having an aspect suggests or implies something problematic for the PC<br />
or multiple PCs, but unlike a compel, it’s something they can’t easily resolve<br />
or deal with in the moment.</p>
<h3 id="you-don-t-always-have-to-destroy-the-world">You Don't Always Have To Destroy The World<a class="headerlink" href="#you-don-t-always-have-to-destroy-the-world" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As you will see from the examples, not all of our urgent, consequential<br />
problems necessarily involve the fate of the world or even a large portion of<br />
the setting. Interpersonal problems can have just as much of an impact on a<br />
group of PCs as stopping this week’s bad guy—winning someone’s respect or<br />
resolving an ongoing dispute between two characters can just as easily take<br />
the focus for a scenario as whatever grand scheme your badass villain is<br />
cooking up.</p>
<p>If you want a classic action-adventure story setup, see if you can come up<br />
with two main problems for your scenario—one that focuses on something<br />
external to the characters (like the villain’s scheme), and one that deals<br />
with interpersonal issues. The latter will serve as a subplot in your scenario<br />
and give the characters some development time while they’re in the midst of<br />
dealing with other problems.</p>
<h2 id="problems-and-character-aspects">Problems and Character Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-and-character-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When you’re trying to get a problem from a character aspect, try fitting it<br />
into this sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have <strong><em>_ aspect, which implies </em></strong>_ (and this may be a list of things, by the way). Because of that, ____ would probably be a big problem for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second blank is what makes this a little harder than an event compel—you<br />
have to think about all the different potential implications of an aspect.<br />
Here are some questions to help with that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who might have a problem with the character because of this aspect?</li>
<li>Does the aspect point to a potential threat to that character?</li>
<li>Does the aspect describe a connection or relationship that could cause trouble for the character?</li>
<li>Does the aspect speak to a backstory element that could come back to haunt the character?</li>
<li>Does the aspect describe something or someone important to the character that you can threaten?</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as whatever you put in the third blank fits the criteria at the<br />
beginning of this section, you’re good to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere has <span class="aspect">Infamous Girl With Sword</span>, which implies that<br />
her reputation precedes her across the countryside. Because of that, a copycat<br />
committing crimes in her name and getting the inhabitants of the next city she<br />
visits angry and murderous would probably be a big problem for her.</p>
<p>Landon has an aspect of <span class="aspect">I Owe Old Finn Everything</span>, which<br />
implies that he’d feel obligated to help Finn out with any personal problems.<br />
Because of that, having to bail Finn’s son out of a gambling debt he owes to<br />
some very nasty people would probably be a big problem for him.</p>
<p>Zird has <span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia Arcana</span>, which implies<br />
that some or many of them are scheming against him constantly. Because of<br />
that, a series of concentrated assassination attempts from someone or several<br />
people who know how to get past all his magical defenses would probably be a<br />
big problem for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="problems-and-game-aspects">Problems and Game Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-and-game-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Problems you get from a game’s current and impending issues will be a little<br />
wider in scope than character-driven problems, affecting all your PCs and<br />
possibly a significant number of NPCs as well. They’re less personal, but that<br />
doesn’t mean they have to be less compelling (pardon the pun).</p>
<ul>
<li>Because <strong><em>_ is an issue, it implies </em></strong>_. Therefore, ____ would probably create a big problem for the PCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What threats does the issue present to the PCs?</li>
<li>Who are the driving forces behind the issue, and what messed up thing might they be willing to do to advance their agenda?</li>
<li>Who else cares about dealing with the issue, and how might their “solution” be bad for the PCs?</li>
<li>What’s a good next step for resolving the issue, and what makes accomplishing that step hard?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="put-a-face-on-it">Put A Face On It<a class="headerlink" href="#put-a-face-on-it" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>While not all of your scenario problems have to be directly caused by an NPC<br />
who serves as a “master villain” for the PCs to take down, it’s often easier<br />
if they are. At the very least, you should be able to point directly to an NPC<br />
who benefits a great deal from the scenario problem not going the way the PCs<br />
want it to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because <span class="aspect">The Scar Triad</span> is an issue, it implies that the<br />
Triad is making a serious power play across the land. Therefore, a complete<br />
government takeover by Triad members in the city they’re sent to on their next<br />
job would probably create a big problem for the PCs.</p>
<p>Because <span class="aspect">The Doom that Is to Come</span> is an issue, it implies<br />
that agents of the Cult of Tranquility are constantly trying to fulfill parts<br />
of the ancient prophecies that foretell the doom. Therefore, a series of<br />
ritual murders in the next town meant to awaken an ancient demon that sleeps<br />
under the town would probably create a big problem for the PCs.</p>
<p>Because the Cult of Tranquility’s <span class="aspect">Two Conflicting<br />
Prophecies</span> is an issue, it implies that there’s an internal Cult<br />
struggle to validate one prophecy as being definitive. Therefore, an all-out<br />
war between rival factions in the next town that brings innocents into the<br />
crossfire would probably create a big problem for the PCs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="problems-and-aspect-pairs">Problems and Aspect Pairs<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-and-aspect-pairs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is where you really start cooking with gas. You can also create problems<br />
from the relationship between two aspects instead of relying on just one. That<br />
lets you keep things personal, but broaden the scope of your problem to impact<br />
multiple characters, or thread a particular PC’s story into the story of the<br />
game.</p>
<p>There are two main forms of aspect pairing: connecting two character aspects,<br />
and connecting a character aspect to an issue.</p>
<h3 id="two-character-aspects">Two Character Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#two-character-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Because <strong><em>_ has </em></strong><em> aspect and <strong><em>_ has </em></strong></em> aspect, it implies that <strong><em>_. Therefore, </em></strong>_ would probably be a big problem for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the two aspects put those characters at odds or suggest a point of tension between them?</li>
<li>Is there a particular kind of problem or trouble that both would be likely to get into because of the aspects?</li>
<li>Does one character have a relationship or a connection that could become problematic for the other?</li>
<li>Do the aspects point to backstory elements that can intersect in the present?</li>
<li>Is there a way for one PC’s fortune to become another’s misfortune, because of the aspects?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Because Landon is a <span class="aspect">Disciple of the Ivory Shroud</span>, and<br />
Zird has <span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia Arcana</span>, it implies that<br />
both factions could occasionally cross paths and have incompatible agendas.<br />
Therefore, a mandate from the monks of a local Shroud monastery to capture or<br />
kill the members of a local Collegia chapterhouse for an unknown slight would<br />
probably be a big problem for them.</p>
<p>Because Cynere is <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny Things</span>, and Landon<br />
has <span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat</span>, it implies that they’re<br />
probably the worst partners for any kind of undercover heist. Therefore, a<br />
contract to infiltrate the Royal Ball of Ictherya with no backup and walk out<br />
with the Crown Jewels on behalf of a neighboring kingdom would probably be a<br />
big problem for them.</p>
<p>Because Zird has <span class="aspect">If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve Read About<br />
It</span>, and Cynere is the <span class="aspect">Secret Sister of Barathar</span>, it<br />
implies that proof of Cynere’s true heritage could one day fall into Zird’s<br />
hands. Therefore, the unexpected arrival of a genealogical document in code<br />
that Barathar and her henchies seek to recover at all costs would probably be<br />
a big problem for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="character-aspect-and-issue">Character Aspect and Issue<a class="headerlink" href="#character-aspect-and-issue" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Because you have <strong><em>_ aspect and </em></strong><em> is an issue, it implies that <strong><em>_. Therefore, </em></strong></em> would probably be a big problem for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue suggest a threat to any of the PC’s relationships?</li>
<li>Is the next step to dealing with the issue something that impacts a particular character personally because of their aspects?</li>
<li>Does someone connected to the issue have a particular reason to target the PC because of an aspect?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-many-problems-do-i-need">How Many Problems Do I Need<a class="headerlink" href="#how-many-problems-do-i-need" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>For a single scenario, one or two is sufficient, trust us. You’ll see below<br />
that even one problem can create enough material for two or three sessions.<br />
Don’t feel like you have to engage every PC with every scenario—rotate the<br />
spotlight around a little so that they each get some spotlight time, and then<br />
throw in an issue-related scenario when you want to concentrate on the larger<br />
“plot” of the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because Cynere is the <span class="aspect">Secret Sister of Barathar</span> and<br />
<span class="aspect">The Scar Triad</span> is an issue, it implies that the Triad<br />
could have leverage over Cynere for blackmail. Therefore, the Triad hiring her<br />
for an extremely dangerous and morally reprehensible job on the threat of<br />
revealing her secret to the world and making her a public enemy across the<br />
land would probably be a big problem for her.</p>
<p>Because Zird has <span class="aspect">If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve Read About<br />
It</span>, and the Cult of Tranquility’s <span class="aspect">Two Conflicting<br />
Prophecies</span> are an issue, it implies that Zird could be the key to<br />
figuring out which of the prophecies is legitimate. Therefore, getting<br />
approached by the Primarch to learn the Rites of Tranquility and figure out<br />
the truth of the prophecy, and thus becoming a target for manipulation from<br />
both major factions, would probably be a big problem for him.</p>
<p>Because Landon has <span class="aspect">An Eye for an Eye</span>, and<br />
<span class="aspect">The Doom that Is to Come</span> is an issue, it implies that<br />
anything the Cult does to Landon’s loved ones would be met with a desire for<br />
vengeance. Therefore, an attack on his hometown by Cult agents on the prowl<br />
for more indoctrinated servants as preparation for the End Times would<br />
probably be a big problem for him.</p>
