<h2 id="what-the-gamemaster-does">What the Gamemaster Does<a class="headerlink" href="#what-the-gamemaster-does" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you’re the gamemaster, then your job is a little different from everyone<br />
else’s. This section is going to give you a bunch of tools to make that job<br />
easier during play.</p>
<p>The GM’s job was discussed a bit in <a href="../../fate-
core/basics">The Basics</a>, but let’s take a more detailed look at your unique<br />
responsibilities.</p>
<h2 id="start-and-end-scenes">Start and End Scenes<a class="headerlink" href="#start-and-end-scenes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>One of your primary responsibilities during the game is to decide definitively<br />
when a scene begins and ends. This might not seem like that big a deal, but it<br />
is, because it means that you’re the person primarily responsible for the<br />
pacing of each session. If you start scenes too early, it takes a long time to<br />
get to the main action. If you don’t end them soon enough, then they drag on<br />
and it takes you a long time to get anything significant done.</p>
<p>The players will sometimes help you with this, if they’re keen on getting to<br />
the next bit of action, but sometimes they’ll naturally be inclined to spend<br />
too much time bantering in character or focusing on minutiae. When that<br />
happens, it’s your job to step in like a good movie editor and say, “I think<br />
we’ve pretty much milked this scene for all it’s worth. What do we want to do<br />
next?”</p>
<p>We have more advice on starting and ending scenes in the next section,<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/scenes-sessions-
scenarios" title="Scenes, Sessions, &amp; Scenarios">Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios</a>.</p>
<h3 id="drama-is-better-than-realism">Drama Is Better Than Realism<a class="headerlink" href="#drama-is-better-than-realism" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In Fate, don’t get too bogged down trying to maintain absolute consistency in<br />
the world or adhere to a draconian sense of realism. The game operates by the<br />
rules of drama and fiction; use that to your advantage. There should be very<br />
few moments in the game where the PCs are free of conflicts or problems to<br />
deal with, even if it’d be more “realistic” for them to get a long breather.</p>
<p>When you’re trying to decide what happens, and the answer that makes the most<br />
sense is also kind of boring, go with something that’s more exciting than<br />
sensible! You can always find a way later on to justify something that doesn’t<br />
make immediate sense.</p>
<h2 id="play-the-world-and-the-npcs">Play the World and the NPCs<a class="headerlink" href="#play-the-world-and-the-npcs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As the gamemaster, it’s your job to decide how everyone and everything else in<br />
the world responds to what the PCs do, as well as what the PCs’ environment is<br />
like. If a PC botches a roll, you’re the one who gets to decide the<br />
consequences. When an NPC attempts to assassinate a PC’s friend, you’re the<br />
one who gets to decide how they go about it. When the PCs stroll up to a food<br />
vendor in a market, you get to decide what kind of day the vendor is having,<br />
what kind of personality he or she has, what’s on sale that day. You determine<br />
the weather when the PCs pull up to that dark cave.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to do this in a vacuum—you have a lot of tools to<br />
help you decide what would be appropriate. The process we outline in <a href="../../fate-core/game-creation">Game<br />
Creation</a> should provide you with a<br />
lot of context about the game you’re running, whether that’s in the form of<br />
aspects like current and impending issues, specific locations that you might<br />
visit, or NPCs with strong agendas that you can use.</p>
<p>The PCs’ aspects also help you decide how to make the world respond to them.<br />
As stated in the Aspects and Fate Points section, the <a href="../../fate-core/making-good-aspect" title="Making A Good
Aspect">best aspects have a<br />
double edge</a> to them. You have a lot of power to exploit that double edge by<br />
using event-based compels. That way, you kill two birds with one stone—you add<br />
detail and surprise to your game world, but you also keep the PCs at the<br />
center of the story you’re telling.</p>
<p>This facet of your job also means that when you have NPCs in a scene, you<br />
speak for and make decisions for them like the players do for their PCs—you<br />
decide when they’re taking an action that requires dice, and you follow the<br />
same rules the players do for determining how that turns out. Your NPCs are<br />
going to be a little different than the PCs, however, depending on how<br />
important they are to the story.</p>
<h3 id="let-the-players-help-you">Let the Players Help You<a class="headerlink" href="#let-the-players-help-you" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You don’t have to shoulder the whole burden of making up world details<br />
yourself. Remember, the more collaborative you get, the more emotional<br />
investment the players are going to have in the result, because they shared in<br />
its creation.</p>
<p>If a character has an aspect that connects them to someone or something in the<br />
world, make that player your resident “expert” on whatever the aspect refers<br />
to. So if someone has <span class="aspect">Scars from the Great War</span>, poll that<br />
player for information whenever the Great War comes up in conversation. “You<br />
notice that this sergeant is wearing a veteran’s mark, which is a rare<br />
decoration from the War. What hardcore crap do you have to do to get one of<br />
those? Do you have one?” Some players will defer back to you, and that’s fine,<br />
but it’s important that you keep making the offer so as to foster a<br />
collaborative atmosphere.</p>
<p>Also, one of the main uses of the <a href="../..
/fate-core/four-actions">create an advantage action</a> is precisely to give players a way to add details to<br />
the world through their characters. Use that to your advantage when you draw a<br />
blank or simply want to delegate more control. One good way to do this during<br />
play is to answer the player’s question with a question, if they ask for<br />
information.</p>
<p>Ryan: “Is there a way to disrupt this magical construct without killing the<br />
subjects trapped in it?”</p>
<p>Amanda: “Well, you know that it’s using their life force to power itself. If<br />
there were a way to do that, what do you think it’d look like? I mean, you’re<br />
the expert wizard, you tell me.”</p>
<p>Ryan: “Hm... I think there’d be some kind of counter-incantation, like a<br />
failsafe mechanism in case things go horribly wrong.”</p>
<p>Amanda: "Yeah, that sounds good. Roll Lore to see if that's there."</p>
<h2 id="judge-the-use-of-the-rules">Judge the Use of the Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#judge-the-use-of-the-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>It’s also your job to make most of the moment-to-moment decisions about what’s<br />
legit and what’s not regarding the rules. Most often, you’re going to decide<br />
when something in the game deserves a roll, what type of action that is<br />
(overcome, attack, etc.) and how difficult that roll is. In conflicts, this<br />
can get a little more complicated, like determining if a situation aspect<br />
should force someone to make an overcome action, or deciding whether or not a<br />
player can justify a particular advantage they’re trying to create.</p>
<p>You also judge the appropriateness of any invocations or compels that come up<br />
during play, like we talked about in the <a href="../../fate-core/aspects-fate-points" title="Aspects and Fate Points">Aspects and Fate Points </a>section, and<br />
make sure that everyone at the table is clear on what’s going on. With<br />
invocations, this is pretty easy—as long as the player can explain why the<br />
aspect is relevant, you’re good to go. With compels, it can get a little more<br />
complicated, because you need to articulate precisely what complication the<br />
player is agreeing to.</p>
<p>We provide some more tips on judging the use of rules below.</p>
<h3 id="you-re-the-chairman-not-god">You're the Chairman, Not God<a class="headerlink" href="#you-re-the-chairman-not-god" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Approach your position as arbiter of the rules by thinking of yourself as<br />
“first among equals” in a committee, rather than as an absolute authority. If<br />
there’s a disagreement on the use of the rules, try encouraging a brief<br />
discussion and let everyone talk freely, rather than making a unilateral<br />
decision. A lot of times, you’ll find that the group is self-policing—if<br />
someone tries to throw out a compel that’s a real stretch, it’s just as likely<br />
that another player will bring it up before you do.</p>
<p>Your job is really to have the “last word” on any rules-related subject,<br />
rather than to dictate from your chair. Keep that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="create-scenarios-and-nearly-everything-else">Create Scenarios (and Nearly Everything Else)<a class="headerlink" href="#create-scenarios-and-nearly-everything-else" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Finally, you’re responsible for making all of the stuff that the PCs encounter<br />
and react to in the game. That not only includes NPCs with skills and aspects,<br />
but it also includes the aspects on scenes, environments, and objects, as well<br />
as the dilemmas and challenges that make up a scenario of Fate. You provide<br />
the prompts that give your group a reason to play this game to begin with—what<br />
problems they face, what issues they have to resolve, whom they’re opposing,<br />
and what they’ll have to go through in order to win the day.</p>
<p>This job gets a whole section all on its own. See <a href="../../fate-core/scenes-sessions-scenarios">Scenes, Sessions, and<br />
Scenarios</a>.</p>
