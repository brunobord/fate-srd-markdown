    <p>Fate Core</p>
<h1 id="fate-points">Fate Points<a class="headerlink" href="#fate-points" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>You use tokens to represent how many fate points you have at any given time<br />
during play. Fate points are one of your most important resources in<br />
Fate—they’re a measure of how much influence you have to make the story go in<br />
your character’s favor.</p>
<p>You can spend fate points to <strong>invoke</strong> an aspect, to declare a story detail,<br />
or to activate certain powerful stunts.</p>
<p>You earn fate points by accepting a <strong>compel</strong> on one of your aspects.</p>
<p>A word of warning: don’t use edible things as tokens, especially if the food<br />
hasn’t arrived yet.</p>
<h2 id="invoking-an-aspect">Invoking an Aspect<a class="headerlink" href="#invoking-an-aspect" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you’re making a skill roll, and you’re in a situation where an<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/invoking-
compelling-aspects" title="Invoking An Aspect">aspect might be able to help you</a>, you can spend a fate point to<br />
invoke it in order to change the dice result.<strong> This allows you to either<br />
reroll the dice or add +2 to your roll, whichever is more helpful.</strong><br />
(Typically, +2 is a good choice if you rolled –2 or higher, but sometimes you<br />
want to risk a reroll to get that +4.) You do this after you’ve rolled the<br />
dice—if you aren’t happy with your total.</p>
<p><strong>You also have to explain or justify how the aspect is helpful in order to get the bonus</strong>—sometimes it’ll be self-evident, and sometimes it might require some creative narrating.</p>
<p>You can spend more than one fate point on a single roll, gaining another<br />
reroll or an additional +2, as long as each point you spend invokes a<br />
different aspect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere is trying to covertly goad a merchant into describing the security<br />
features of his personal vault by posing as a visiting dignitary. The merchant<br />
is giving her passive opposition at Good (+3), and her Deceive skill is Fair<br />
(+2).</p>
<p>Lily rolls. She breaks even, getting a 0. That leaves her result at Fair,<br />
not enough to get the information she wants.</p>
<p>She looks at her character sheet, then to Amanda, and says, “You know, long<br />
years of being <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny Things</span> has taught me a<br />
thing or two about what’s in a treasure hoard and what’s not. I’m going to<br />
impress this merchant by talking about the rarest, most prized elements of his<br />
collection.”</p>
<p>Amanda grins and nods. Lily hands over a fate point to invoke the aspect,<br />
and gets to add +2 to her standing roll. This brings her result to a Great<br />
(+4), which exceeds the opposition. The duly impressed merchant starts to brag<br />
about his vault, and Cynere listens intently....</p>

<h2 id="declaring-a-story-detail">Declaring a Story Detail<a class="headerlink" href="#declaring-a-story-detail" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, you want to add a detail that works to your character’s advantage<br />
in a scene. For example, you might use this to narrate a convenient<br />
coincidence, like retroactively having the right supplies for a certain job<br />
(“Of course I brought that along!”), showing up at a dramatically appropriate<br />
moment, or suggesting that you and the NPC you just met have mutual clients in<br />
common.</p>
<p>To do this, you’ll spend a fate point. You should try to justify your story<br />
details by relating them to your aspects. GMs, you have the right to veto any<br />
suggestions that seem out of scope or ask the player to revise them,<br />
especially if the rest of the group isn’t buying into it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zird the Arcane gets captured with his friends by some tribesfolk from the<br />
Sagroth Wilds. The three heroes are unceremoniously dumped before the<br />
chieftain, and Amanda describes the chieftain addressing them in a strange,<br />
guttural tongue.</p>
<p>Ryan looks at his sheet and says, “Hey, I have <span class="aspect">If I Haven’t<br />
Been There, I’ve Read About It</span> on my sheet. Can I declare that I’ve<br />
studied this language at some point, so we can communicate?”</p>
<p>Amanda thinks that’s perfectly reasonable to assume. Ryan tosses over a fate<br />
point and describes Zird answering in the chieftain’s own speech, which turns<br />
all eyes in the village (including those of his friends) on him in a moment of<br />
surprise.</p>
<p>Ryan has Zird look at his friends and say, “Books. They’re good for you.”</p>

<h2 id="compels">Compels<a class="headerlink" href="#compels" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes (in fact, probably often), <a href="../../fate-core/invoking-compelling-
aspects" title="Being Compelled">you’ll find yourself in a situation<br />
where an aspect complicates</a> your character’s life and creates unexpected<br />
drama. When that happens, the GM will suggest a potential complication that<br />
might arise. This is called a compel.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a compel means your character automatically fails at some goal, or<br />
your character’s choices are restricted, or simply that unintended<br />
consequences cloud whatever your character does. You might negotiate back and<br />
forth on the details a little, to arrive at what would be most appropriate and<br />
dramatic in the moment.</p>
<p>Once you’ve agreed to accept the complication, you get a fate point for your<br />
troubles. If you want, you can pay a fate point to prevent the complication<br />
from happening, but it is not recommended that you do that very often—you’ll<br />
probably need that fate point later, and getting compelled brings drama (and<br />
hence, fun) into your game’s story.</p>
<p>Players, you’re going to call for a compel when you want there to be a<br />
complication in a decision you’ve just made, if it’s related to one of your<br />
aspects. GMs, you’re going to call for a compel when you make the world<br />
respond to the characters in a complicated or dramatic way.</p>
<p>Anyone at the table is free to suggest when a compel might be appropriate for<br />
any character (including their own). GMs, you have the final word on whether<br />
or not a compel is valid. And speak up if you see that a compel happened<br />
naturally as a result of play, but no fate points were awarded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landon has the aspect <span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat</span>. He is<br />
attending the annual Grand Ball in Ictherya with his friends, courtesy of the<br />
royal court.</p>
<p>Amanda tells the players, “As you’re milling about, a sharply dressed young<br />
lady catches Landon sticking out of the crowd. She observes him for a while,<br />
then goes to engage him in conversation, obviously intrigued by how different<br />
he looks among all the stuffy nobles.” She turns to Lenny. “What do you do?”</p>
<p>Lenny says, “Uh... well, I guess I’ll ask her to dance and play along, see<br />
what I can find out about her.”</p>
<p>Amanda holds up a fate point and says, “And is that going to go wrong, given<br />
Landon’s excellent command of courtly etiquette?”</p>
<p>Lenny chuckles and replies, “Yeah, I presume Landon will offend her pretty<br />
quickly, and that’ll get complicated. I’ll take the fate point.”</p>
<p>Amanda and Lenny play a bit to figure out just how Landon puts his foot in<br />
his mouth, and then Amanda describes some of the royal guard showing up. One<br />
of them says, “You might want to watch how you speak to the High Duchess of<br />
Ictherya, outlander.”</p>
<p>Lenny shakes his head. Amanda grins the grin of the devil.</p>
