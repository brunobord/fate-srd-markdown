<p>When you sit down to play Fate, you might just play a single session. That’s a<br />
viable way to play the game, but let’s assume that you want it to go a bit<br />
longer. What you need, then, is an arc.</p>
<p>An <a href="../../fate-core/building-arc">arc is a complete storyline</a> with<br />
its own themes, situations, antagonists, innocent bystanders, and endgame,<br />
told in the span of a few scenarios (somewhere between two and five, usually).<br />
You don’t need to have everything planned out (in fact, you probably<br />
shouldn’t, given that no meticulously planned story ever survives contact with<br />
the players), but you need to have an idea of where things begin and end, and<br />
what might happen in the middle.</p>
<p>To make a fictional analogy, an arc is a lot like a single book. It tells its<br />
own story and ends when it’s done; you provide some form of closure and move<br />
on. Sometimes you move on to another story, and sometimes your book is just<br />
the first in a series of books. That’s when you have a campaign.</p>
<h2 id="defining-campaigns">Defining Campaigns<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-campaigns" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When you have multiple arcs that are connected and told in a sequence, and<br />
that have an overarching story or theme that runs through all of them, you<br />
have a campaign. <a href="../../fate-core/building-campaign">Campaigns are long, taking months or even years to complete<br />
</a> (if you ever do).</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn’t need to be as scary as it might sound. Yes, a campaign<br />
is long and large and complex. You don’t, however, need to come up with the<br />
whole thing at once. As with an arc, you may have an idea where it begins and<br />
ends (and that can be helpful), but you really only need to plan an arc at a<br />
time.</p>
<p>See, the players are so prone to shaking things up and changing things on you<br />
that planning more than one arc at a time is often frustrating and futile.<br />
Planning the second arc of a campaign based on the events of the first arc,<br />
how it turned out, and what your players did, though...well, that can make for<br />
very satisfying play.</p>
