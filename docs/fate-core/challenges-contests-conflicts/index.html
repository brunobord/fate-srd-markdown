<p>Most of the time, a single skill roll should be enough to decide how a<br />
particular situation in play resolves. You’re not obligated to describe<br />
actions in a particular timeframe or level of detail when you use a skill.<br />
Therefore, you could use a single Athletics roll to find out whether you can<br />
safely navigate a rock face that will take days to climb, or use that same<br />
single skill roll to find out whether you can safely avoid a swiftly falling<br />
tree that’s about to crush you.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, you’ll be in a situation where you’re doing something<br />
really dramatic and interesting, like pivotal set pieces in a movie or a book.<br />
When that happens, it’s a good idea to zoom in on the action and deal with it<br />
using multiple skill rolls, because the wide range of dice results will make<br />
things really dynamic and surprising. Most fight scenes fall into this<br />
category, but you can zoom in on anything that you consider sufficiently<br />
important—car chases, court trials, high-stakes poker games, and so on.</p>
<p>We have three ways for you to zoom in on the action in Fate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../fate-core/challenges">Challenges</a>, when one or more characters try to achieve something dynamic or complicated</li>
<li><a href="../../fate-core/contests">Contests</a>, when two or more characters are competing for a goal</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/conflicts">Conflicts</a>, when two or more characters are trying to directly harm each other</p>
</li>
