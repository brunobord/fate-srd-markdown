<p><strong>If you want to skip making a detailed character and just want to play, you can leave most of the character blank and fill in as you play.</strong></p>
<p>At minimum, you need to have the following filled out to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>High concept aspect</li>
<li>Best skill</li>
<li>Name</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to your high concept, you can start off vague and refine the<br />
aspect later. <span class="aspect">Guy with Sword</span> is an okay high concept for<br />
this method, and later you might discover something about your character that<br />
puts a spin on it. When that happens, rewrite the aspect to reflect that spin.</p>
<p>You should know your best skill to start—that gives us further ideas about<br />
your character. If you have any other thoughts on skills, either skills you’re<br />
good at or skills you’re bad at, write those down. (Since you don’t normally<br />
write down any skills you have at lower than Average (+1), just make a note on<br />
your sheet about those skills you’re intentionally saying you don’t have.)</p>
<p>And, of course, you need a name! Maybe a first name is all you need for the<br />
moment, or a nickname. (There’s also the trick of giving yourself a name, only<br />
to later reveal that you’ve been hiding, are undercover, or have amnesia, and<br />
write down what your real name is.)</p>
<h2 id="starting-play">Starting Play<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>With this method, you start with 3 refresh, so you’ll start playing with 3<br />
fate points.</p>
<p>After the first session is over, if you’re planning on playing your character<br />
again, you should take time to fill in the rest of the aspects, skills, and<br />
stunts.</p>
<h2 id="filling-aspects-in-play">Filling Aspects in Play<a class="headerlink" href="#filling-aspects-in-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Unless you immediately have an idea for your trouble aspect, you’ll fill that<br />
in later. With the other three aspects, since you’re skipping the Phase Trio,<br />
you’ll just make up whatever aspect seems interesting to you at the moment.<br />
Typically you’ll do this when you need an aspect on your character to achieve<br />
something, or you want to turn a situation that’s happening into something<br />
that’s compel-worthy.</p>
<p>As with high concept, don’t stress about getting this aspect dead-on. After<br />
the session’s over, take some time to look over and tweak the aspects you’ve<br />
created on the fly.</p>
<h2 id="filling-skills-in-play">Filling Skills in Play<a class="headerlink" href="#filling-skills-in-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>At any point, if you are using a skill that isn’t on your character sheet, one<br />
of two things happens: you’ll assume the skill is Mediocre (+0), or you’ll<br />
write it down on one of your empty skill slots and roll it at that level. This<br />
choice exists until all of your skill slots are filled in.</p>
<p>If you roll for a skill not on your sheet and choose to go with Mediocre<br />
rather than write it down, you can later fill it in on your sheet as something<br />
higher. For example, you might be called to roll Lore, and choose to roll it<br />
at Mediocre. Later, you might be called to roll it again, and this time you<br />
choose to fill it in at Fair (+2).</p>
<p>Likewise, if you roll well on a skill when you chose to take it at Mediocre,<br />
maybe that’ll inspire you to take that skill later.</p>
<p>Since some skills have secondary benefits, notably adjusting your stress track<br />
and consequences, you can fill those in when you want to declare your<br />
character has such a benefit. Until then, you don’t have those benefits, as<br />
you’re assumed to have that skill at Mediocre.</p>
<h2 id="filling-stunts-in-play">Filling Stunts in Play<a class="headerlink" href="#filling-stunts-in-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You get three stunts for free, which you can fill in at any time. You can fill<br />
in other stunts at any time, but you must pay a fate point for each one to do<br />
so. That’s because your refresh tells you how many fate points you start the<br />
game with, so by taking a stunt, you should have started with fewer.</p>
<p>If you’re out of fate points, but want to note down a stunt you have because<br />
you’re suddenly struck with the idea, do so. But your character doesn’t<br />
actually have it until you gain a fate point and spend it.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to reduce your refresh by one for the next session for each<br />
extra stunt you take.</p>
