<h1 id="what-aspects-do">What Aspects Do<a class="headerlink" href="#what-aspects-do" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In Fate, aspects do two major things: <strong>they tell you what’s important about<br />
the game, and they help you decide when to use the mechanics.</strong></p>
<h2 id="importance">Importance<a class="headerlink" href="#importance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Your collection of game and character aspects tell you what you need to focus<br />
on during your game. Think of them as a message from yourself to yourself, a<br />
set of flags waving you towards the path with the most fun.</p>
<p>GMs, when you make scenarios for Fate, you’re going to use those aspects, and<br />
the connections between aspects, to generate the problems your PCs are going<br />
to solve. Players, your aspects are the reason why your PC stands out from<br />
every other character who might have similar skills—lots of Fate characters<br />
might have a high <a href="../../fate-core/fight">Fight</a> skill, but only<br />
Landon is a <span class="aspect">Disciple of the Ivory Shroud</span>. When his path as<br />
a disciple comes into play, or the Ivory Shroud takes action, it gives the<br />
game a personal touch that it wouldn’t have had otherwise.</p>
<p>The game aspects do something similar on a larger scale—they tell us why to<br />
care about playing this particular game in the first place, what makes it<br />
concrete and compelling to us. Everyone can all say, “Oh, we like space opera<br />
games,” but until the group drills down to the specifics of a universe where<br />
people will do <span class="aspect">Anything for Survival</span>, and where<br />
<span class="aspect">The Empire is Everywhere</span>, they don’t really have anything<br />
to attach their interest to.</p>
<p>Situation aspects make the moment-to-moment interactions of play interesting<br />
by adding color and depth to what might otherwise be a boring scene. A fight<br />
in a tavern is generic by nature—it could be any tavern, anywhere. But when<br />
you add the aspect <span class="aspect">Huge Bronze Devil Statue</span> to the scene,<br />
and people bring it into play, it becomes “that fight we were in at the Bronze<br />
Devil, when I smashed that guy’s head into the statue.” The unique details add<br />
interest and investment.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-when-to-use-mechanics">Deciding When to Use Mechanics<a class="headerlink" href="#deciding-when-to-use-mechanics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Because aspects tell us what’s important, they also tell us when it’s most<br />
appropriate to use the mechanics to deal with a situation, rather than just<br />
letting people decide what happens just by describing what they do.</p>
<p>GMs, this comes up for you most often when you’re trying to figure out whether<br />
to require a player to roll dice. If a player says, “I climb this ladder and<br />
grab the idol,” and there’s nothing special about the ladder or the idol, then<br />
there’s no real reason to require an overcome action to grab it. But if the<br />
situation aspects tell you that the ladder is a <span class="aspect">Rotting Rope<br />
Ladder</span> and the idol is <span class="aspect">Protected by the Wrath of the<br />
Gods</span>, then you suddenly have an element of pressure and risk that makes<br />
it worth going to the dice for.</p>
<p>Players, this comes up for you most often when invoking your aspects and<br />
considering compels. Your aspects highlight what makes your character an<br />
individual, and you want to play that up, right? So when the opportunity comes<br />
up to make your character more awesome by invoking, go for it! When you see an<br />
opportunity to influence the story by suggesting a compel for your character,<br />
do it! The game will be much richer for it as a whole.</p>
