<p>The easiest way to build an arc is not to build one, and it was suggested that<br />
if you have a lot of story questions in one of your scenarios, you can reserve<br />
some of them for the next scenario. Then, in your next scenario, add some new<br />
questions to go with the unanswered ones. Lather, rinse, repeat, and you’ll<br />
have material for three or four scenarios without doing that much additional<br />
work. In addition, that lets you incorporate changes to the characters’<br />
aspects organically, rather than making a plan and having it disrupted.</p>
<p>That said, some GMs want to have a greater sense of structure for the long<br />
run. It is recommended using the same method for building scenarios in the<br />
previous chapter to build arcs, but changing the scope of the story questions<br />
you come up with. Instead of focusing on immediate problems for the PCs to<br />
solve, come up with a more general problem, where the PCs are going to have to<br />
solve smaller problems first in order to have a chance at resolving the larger<br />
one.</p>
<p>The best places to look for arc-sized problems are the current or impending<br />
issues of places or organizations that you came up with during game creation.<br />
If you haven’t made any up yet for a particular place or group, now might be a<br />
good time to do that, so you have material for the arc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda decides she wants to do one major arc for each PC.</p>
<p>For Zird, his <span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia Arcana</span> makes it<br />
pretty easy—she decides that perhaps there’s something more sinister behind<br />
these rivalries, such as an attempt by a dark cult operating from within to<br />
take over the Collegia and turn it to nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>She needs to focus on story questions that are more general and will take<br />
some time to resolve. After thinking about it for a while, she chooses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can Zird uncover the identity of the cult’s leader before the takeover<br />
occurs? (This lets her do individual scenarios about the attempted takeover.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will Zird’s rivals ally with the cult? (This lets her do individual<br />
scenarios about each of Zird’s key rivals.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can Zird reconcile, at long last, with his rivals?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the cult succeed and transform the Collegia forever? (Answering<br />
this question ends the arc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then go through the same process of picking opposing NPCs, keeping in mind<br />
that their influence is supposed to be more far-reaching in an arc than in a<br />
single scenario.</p>
