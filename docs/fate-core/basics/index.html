<p>If you’ve never played a roleplaying game before, here’s the basic idea: you<br />
and a bunch of friends get together to tell an interactive story about a group<br />
of characters you make up. You get to say what challenges and obstacles those<br />
characters face, how they respond, what they say and do, and what happens to<br />
them.</p>
<p>It’s not all just conversation, though—sometimes you’ll use dice and the rules<br />
in this Web site to bring uncertainty into the story and make things more<br />
exciting.</p>
<p>Fate doesn’t come with a default setting, but it works best with any premise<br />
where the characters are proactive, capable people leading dramatic lives.<br />
There is more advice on that under <a href="../../fate-core
/game-creation" title="Game Creation">Game Creation</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re a new player, all you really need to know is in this chapter and on<br />
your character sheet—the GM will help you figure out the rest.</p>
<p>If you’re a new GM, this is just the tip of the iceberg for you. You should<br />
read and get familiar with the whole core rules.</p>
<h3 id="for-veterans">For Veterans<a class="headerlink" href="#for-veterans" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You might be reading this because you’re familiar with Fate from our other<br />
games, <em>Spirit of the Century</em> and <em>The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game</em>.<br />
Several other popular RPGs, like Galileo Games’ <em>Bulldogs!</em> and Cubicle 7’s<br />
<em>Legends of Anglerre</em>, also use the Fate system.</p>
<p>This is a new version of Fate, which was developed to update and streamline<br />
the system. You’ll recognize some of what’s in here, but some rules have<br />
changed as have some terminology. You can find a <a href="../../fate-core/veterans-guide">guide to all the changes<br />
</a> that have been made.</p>
