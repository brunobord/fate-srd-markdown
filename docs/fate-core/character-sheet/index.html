<p>Players, your character sheet contains everything you need to know about your<br />
PC—abilities, personality, significant background elements, and any other<br />
resources that character has to use in the game. Here’s an example of a Fate<br />
character sheet to illustrate all the components.</p>

<h2 id="aspects">Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/types-aspects">Aspects</a> are phrases that describe<br />
some significant detail about a character. They are the reasons why your<br />
character matters, why someone is interested in seeing your character in the<br />
game. Aspects can cover a wide range of elements, such as personality or<br />
descriptive traits, beliefs, relationships, issues and problems, or anything<br />
else that helps us invest in the character as a person, rather than just a<br />
collection of stats.</p>
<p>Aspects come into play in conjunction with fate points. When an aspect<br />
benefits you, you can spend fate points to <a href="../../fate-core
/invoking-compelling-aspects" title="Invoking &amp; Compelling Aspects">invoke</a> that aspect for<br />
a bonus. When your aspects complicate your character’s life, you gain fate<br />
points back—this is called accepting a <a href="../../fate-core
/invoking-compelling-aspects">compel</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lily’s character, Cynere, has the aspect <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny<br />
Things</span> on her sheet, which describes her general tendency to overvalue<br />
material goods and make bad decisions when gems and coin are involved. This<br />
adds an interesting, fun element to the character that gets her into a great<br />
deal of trouble, bringing a lot of personality to the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aspects can describe things that are beneficial or detrimental—in fact, the<br />
best aspects are both.</p>
<p>And aspects don’t just belong to characters; the environment your characters<br />
are in can have aspects attached to it as well.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/skills" title="Skills">Skills</a> are what you use during<br />
the game to do complicated or interesting actions with the dice. Each<br />
character has a number of skills that represent his or her basic capabilities,<br />
including things like perceptiveness, physical prowess, professional training,<br />
education, and other measures of ability.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the player characters have skills rated in steps<br />
from Average (+1) to Great (+4). Higher is better, meaning that the character<br />
is more capable or succeeds more often when using that skill.</p>
<p>If for some reason you need to make a roll using a skill your character<br />
doesn’t have, you can always roll it at Mediocre (+0). There are a couple<br />
exceptions to this, like magic skills that most people don’t have at all.<br />
Learn about <a href="../../fate-core/skills-
stunts">skills in greater detail</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zird the Arcane has the Lore skill at Great (+4), which makes him ideally<br />
suited to knowing a convenient, obscure fact and doing research. He does not<br />
have the Stealth skill, however, so when the game calls upon him to sneak up<br />
on someone (and Amanda will make sure it will), he’ll have to roll that at<br />
Mediocre (+0). Bad news for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="stunts">Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/skills-stunts" title="Stunts">Stunts</a> are special tricks<br />
that your character knows that allow you to get an extra benefit out of a<br />
skill or alter some other game rule to work in your favor. Stunts are like<br />
special moves in a video game, letting you do something unique or distinctive<br />
compared to other characters. Two characters can have the same rating in a<br />
skill, but their stunts might give them vastly different benefits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landon has a stunt called Another Round? It gives him a bonus to get<br />
information from someone with his Rapport skill, provided that he is drinking<br />
with his target in a tavern.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="stress">Stress<a class="headerlink" href="#stress" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/stress-consequences" title="Stress &amp; Consequences">Stress</a> is one of the two options you have to avoid losing a conflict—it represents<br />
temporary fatigue, getting winded, superficial injuries, and so on. You have a<br />
number of stress levels you can burn off to help keep you in a fight, and they<br />
reset at the end of a conflict, once you’ve had a moment to rest and catch<br />
your breath.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences<a class="headerlink" href="#consequences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/stress-consequences">Consequences</a> are the other<br />
option you have to stay in a conflict, but they have a more lasting impact.<br />
Every time you take a consequence, it puts a new aspect on your sheet<br />
describing your injuries. Unlike stress, you have to take time to recover from<br />
a consequence, and it’s stuck on your character sheet in the meantime, which<br />
leaves your character vulnerable to complications or others wishing to take<br />
advantage of your new weakness.</p>
<h2 id="refresh">Refresh<a class="headerlink" href="#refresh" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/stunts-refresh">Refresh</a> is the number of fate<br />
points you get at the start of every game session to spend for your character.<br />
Your total resets to this number unless you had more fate points at the end of<br />
the last session.</p>
