<p>The first step in setting up your Fate game is to decide what sort of people<br />
the protagonists are and what sort of world surrounds them. Your decisions<br />
here will tell you virtually everything you need to know to get the ball<br />
rolling: what the protagonists are good at, what they may or may not care<br />
about, what problems they’re likely to get into, what kind of impact these<br />
characters have on the world, and so on. You don’t need complete answers<br />
(because that’s part of the point of playing the game), but you should have<br />
enough of an idea that answering those questions doesn’t draw a blank.</p>
<p>First, we’ll start by talking about your setting. We’ll handle the specifics<br />
on the protagonists later, in <a href="../../fate-core
/character-creation" title="Character Creation">Character Creation</a>.</p>
