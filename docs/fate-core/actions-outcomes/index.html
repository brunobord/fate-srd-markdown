<p>You roll the dice when there’s some kind of interesting opposition keeping you<br />
from achieving your goals. If there’s no interesting opposition, you just<br />
accomplish whatever you say you’re trying to do.</p>
<p>As said previously, characters in a Fate game solve their problems<br />
proactively. Players, during the game you’re going to do a lot—you might break<br />
into the bad guy’s fortress, pilot a starship past a minefield, rally a group<br />
of people into a protest, or poll a network of informants to get the latest<br />
word on the street.</p>
<p>Whenever you take action, there’s a good chance that something or someone is<br />
going to be in your way. It wouldn’t be an interesting story if the bad guy<br />
just rolled over and handed you victory on a plate—clearly, he’s got some<br />
crazy security measures to keep you out of his place. Or the mines are<br />
unstable and already blowing up around you. Or the protesters are really<br />
scared of the cops. Or someone’s been bribing the informants to keep quiet.</p>
<p>That’s when it’s time to take out the dice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the character’s skill that is appropriate to the <a href="../../fate-core/taking-action-dice-ladder">action</a>.</li>
<li>Roll four Fate dice.</li>
<li>Add together the symbols showing on the dice. A <span class="fate_font">+</span> is +1, a <span class="fate_font">-</span> is –1, and a <span class="fate_font">0</span> is 0.</li>
<li>Add your skill rating to the dice roll. The total is your result on the ladder.</li>
<li>If you invoke an aspect, add +2 to your result or reroll the dice.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere needs to bribe her way past the guards keeping her from entering the<br />
city of Thaalar. Amanda says she’ll do this as a straight-up overcome action,<br />
because the guards are nameless NPCs anyway and not really worth a <a href="../../fate-core/conflicts">conflict<br />
</a>.</p>
<p>Lily looks through Cynere’s skill list and picks Resources as her skill,<br />
hoping she can scrounge enough out of her coin purse to satisfy them. Her<br />
Resources skill is Average (+1), so she’ll add one to whatever result she gets<br />
from rolling the dice.</p>
<p>She rolls and gets: <span class="fate_font">+-0+</span></p>
<p>Her total result is +2 (+1 from her dice and +1 from her skill of Average),<br />
which corresponds to a Fair on the ladder.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="opposition">Opposition<a class="headerlink" href="#opposition" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As said in <a href="../../fate-core/basics">The Basics</a>, whenever you roll<br />
the dice, you’re comparing your roll to your opposition. Opposition is either<br />
active, meaning it’s another person rolling dice against you, or passive,<br />
meaning that it’s just a set rating on the ladder which represents the<br />
influence of the environment or situation you’re in. GMs, it’s your job to<br />
decide what the most reasonable source of opposition is.</p>
<p>Amanda decides to roll active opposition against Lily on behalf of the guards.<br />
She decides the most appropriate opposing skill is Will—they’re trying to<br />
resist the temptation of bribery, after all.</p>
<p>The guards are nameless NPCs with no reason to be particularly strong of will,<br />
so she gives them a Mediocre (+0). She rolls and gets:<br />
<span class="fate_font">++0+</span></p>
<p>...for an incredibly lucky result of +3!</p>
<p>That gives her a Good (+3) result, beating Lily’s roll by one.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-gm-active-or-passive">For the GM: Active or Passive?<a class="headerlink" href="#for-the-gm-active-or-passive" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If a PC or a named NPC can reasonably interfere with whatever the action is,<br />
then you should give them the opportunity to roll active opposition. This does<br />
not count as an action for the opposing character; it’s just a basic property<br />
of resolving actions. In other words, a player doesn’t have to do anything<br />
special to earn the right to actively oppose an action, as long as the<br />
character is present and can interfere. If there’s any doubt, having an<br />
appropriate situation aspect helps justify why a character gets to actively<br />
oppose someone else.</p>
<p>If there is no character in the way, then look at your situation aspects in<br />
this scene to see if any of them justify some sort of obstacle, or consider<br />
the circumstances (like rough terrain, a complex lock, time running out, a<br />
situational complication, etc.). If something sounds interesting, choose<br />
passive opposition and set a rating on the ladder.</p>
<p>Sometimes you’re going to run into edge cases, where something inanimate seems<br />
like it should provide active opposition (like an automated gun) or an NPC<br />
can’t provide proactive resistance (like if they’re unaware of what the PC is<br />
doing). Follow your gut—use the type of opposition that fits the circumstances<br />
or makes the scene more interesting.</p>
