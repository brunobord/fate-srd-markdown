<p>start play with.</p>
<p>Stunts change how skills work for your character. Picking and inventing stunts<br />
are covered in the <a href="../../fate-core/skills-stunts">Skills and Stunts</a><br />
section.</p>
<p>You get three stunts for free, and you can take up to two more stunts at the<br />
cost of lowering your refresh by one each. (The gist is this: the more cool<br />
tricks you can do, the more you’ll need to accept compels to get fate points.)<br />
Figuring out stunts can take a while, so you may want to pick one for now and<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/phase-trio">determine the rest of them during play</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lily decides to take the Warmaster stunt as one of her freebies: +2 to Fight<br />
rolls made to create an advantage against an opponent, provided the opponent<br />
has a fighting style or weakness she can exploit.</p>
<p>For her remaining free stunts, she picks Second-Story Girl and Danger Sense.<br />
You can see the write-ups for these on her character sheet.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-refresh">Adjusting Refresh<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-refresh" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A player character in Fate starts with a refresh of 3. That means he’ll start<br />
each session off with at least <a href="../../fate-core
/aspects-fate-points" title="Aspects &amp; Fate Points">3 fate points</a>.</p>
<p>If you pick four stunts, your refresh is 2. If you pick five stunts, your<br />
refresh is 1.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> some Fate games will change this setup. Regardless of how stunts work in your game, you can never have a refresh lower than 1.</p>
<p>You can adjust these defaults if you want to, and give out more free stunts if<br />
you want the PCs to have a lot of cool tricks and special bonuses. You can<br />
also change the default refresh rate—higher refresh means that the PCs won’t<br />
need to take compels as often (think 4-color superhero comics), and lower<br />
refresh means they’ll need to take several early in every session in order to<br />
have a decent supply (think <em>Die Hard</em>). Also, the higher your refresh, the<br />
more likely it is that players will buy stunts.</p>
