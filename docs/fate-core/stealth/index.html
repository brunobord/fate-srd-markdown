    <p>Fate Core</p>
<h1 id="stealth">Stealth<a class="headerlink" href="#stealth" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The Stealth skill allows you to avoid detection, both when hiding in place and<br />
trying to move about unseen. It pairs well with the <a href="../..
/fate-core/burglary">Burglary</a> skill.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: You can use Stealth to get past any<br />
situation that primarily depends on you not being seen. Sneaking past sentries<br />
and security, hiding from a pursuer, avoiding leaving evidence as you pass<br />
through a place, and any other such uses all fall under the purview of<br />
Stealth.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: You’ll mainly use Stealth<br />
to create aspects on yourself, setting yourself in an ideal position for an<br />
attack or ambush in a conflict. That way, you can be <span class="aspect">Well-<br />
Hidden</span> when the guards pass by and take advantage of that, or<br />
<span class="aspect">Hard to Pin Down</span> if you’re fighting in the dark.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Stealth isn’t used to make attacks.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: You can use this to foil Notice attempts<br />
to pinpoint you or seek you out, as well as to try to throw off the scent of<br />
an Investigate attempt from someone trying to track you.</p>
<h2 id="stealth-stunts">Stealth Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#stealth-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face in the Crowd</strong>. +2 to any Stealth roll to blend into a crowd. What a “crowd” means will depend on the environment—a subway station requires more people to be crowded than a small bar.</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Vanish</strong>. Once per scene, you can vanish while in plain sight by spending a fate point, using a smoke pellet or other mysterious technique. This places the <span class="aspect">Vanished</span> boost on you. While you’re vanished, no one can attack or create an advantage on you until after they’ve succeeded at an overcome roll with Notice to suss out where you went (basically meaning they have to give up an exchange to try). This aspect goes away as soon as you invoke it, or someone makes that overcome roll.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slippery Target</strong>. Provided you’re in darkness or shadow, you can use Stealth to defend against Shoot attacks from enemies that are at least one zone away.</p>
