<p>The Will skill represents your character’s general level of mental fortitude,<br />
the same way that <a href="../../fate-core/physique">Physique</a> represents<br />
your physical fortitude.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: You can use Will to pit yourself against<br />
obstacles that require mental effort. Puzzles and riddles can fall under this<br />
category, as well as any mentally absorbing task, like deciphering a code. Use<br />
Will when it’s only a matter of time before you overcome the mental challenge,<br />
and <a href="../../fate-core/lore">Lore</a> if it takes something more than<br />
brute mental force to get past it. Many of the obstacles that you go up<br />
against with Will might be made part of challenges, to reflect the effort<br />
involved.</p>
<p>Contests of Will might reflect particularly challenging games, like chess, or<br />
competing in a hard set of exams. In settings where magic or psychic abilities<br />
are common, contests of Will are popular occurrences.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: You can use Will to place<br />
aspects on yourself, representing a state of deep concentration or focus.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Will isn’t really used for attacks. That<br />
said, in settings where you allow psychic abilities, full-on psychic conflict<br />
might be something you can do with this skill. <a href="../../fate-core
/building-stunts">That’s the sort of thing that<br />
would be added to Will by taking a stunt or extra</a>.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Will is the main skill you use to defend<br />
against mental attacks from Provoke, representing your control over your<br />
reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: The Will skill gives you additional mental <a href="../../fate-core/stress-consequences">stress boxes or consequence slots</a>. Average (+1) or Fair (+2) gives you a 3-point stress box. Good (+3) or Great (+4) gives you a 3-point and a 4-point stress box. Superb (+5) and above give you an additional mild consequence slot along with the additional stress boxes. This slot can only be used for mental harm.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strength From Determination</strong>. Use Will instead of <a href="../../fate-core/physique">Physique</a> on any overcome rolls representing feats of strength.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Boiled</strong>. You can choose to ignore a mild or moderate consequence for the duration of the scene. It can’t be compelled against you or invoked by your enemies. At the end of the scene it comes back worse, though; if it was a mild consequence it becomes a moderate consequence, and if it was already moderate, it becomes severe.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indomitable</strong>. +2 to defend against Provoke attacks specifically related to intimidation and fear.</p>
