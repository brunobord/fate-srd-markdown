<p>The Notice skill involves just that—noticing things. It’s a counterpart to<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/investigate">Investigate</a>, representing a<br />
character’s overall perception, ability to pick out details at a glance, and<br />
other powers of observation. Usually, when you use Notice, it’s very quick<br />
compared to Investigate, so the kinds of details you get from it are more<br />
superficial, but you also don’t have to expend as much effort to find them.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong><strong>: </strong>You don’t really use Notice to<br />
overcome obstacles too often but when you do it’s used in a reactive way:<br />
noticing something in a scene, hearing a faint sound, spotting the concealed<br />
gun in that guy’s waistband.</p>
<p>Note that this isn’t license for GMs to call for Notice rolls left and right<br />
to see how generally observant the players’ characters are; that’s boring.<br />
Instead, call for Notice rolls when succeeding would result in something<br />
interesting happening and failing would result in something just as<br />
interesting.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: You use Notice to create<br />
aspects based on direct observation—looking over a room for details that stand<br />
out, finding an escape route in a debris-filled building, noticing someone<br />
sticking out in a crowd, etc. When you’re watching people, Notice can tell you<br />
what’s going on with them externally; for internal changes, see Empathy. You<br />
might also use Notice to declare that your character spots something you can<br />
use to your advantage in a situation, such as a convenient <span class="aspect">Escape<br />
Route</span> when you’re trying to get out of a building, or a<br />
<span class="aspect">Subtle Weakness</span> in the enemy’s line of defense. For<br />
example, if you’re in a barroom brawl you could make a Notice roll to say that<br />
you spot a puddle on the floor, right next to your opponent’s feet that could<br />
cause him to slip.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Notice isn’t really used for attacks.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: You can use Notice to defend against any<br />
uses of Stealth to get the drop on you or ambush you, or to discover that<br />
you’re being observed.</p>
<h2 id="notice-stunts">Notice Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#notice-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Danger Sense</strong>. You have an almost preternatural capacity for detecting danger. Your Notice skill works unimpeded by conditions like total concealment, darkness, or other sensory impairments in situations where someone or something intends to harm you.</li>
<li><strong>Body Language Reader</strong>. You can use Notice in place of Empathy to learn the aspects of a target through observation.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reactive Shot</strong>. You can use Notice instead of Shoot to make quick, reactive shots that don’t involve a lot of aiming. However, because you’re having a knee-jerk reaction, you’re not allowed to concretely identify your target before using this stunt. So, for example, you might be able to shoot at someone you see moving in the bushes with this stunt, but you won’t be able to tell if it’s friend or foe before you pull the trigger. Choose carefully!</p>
