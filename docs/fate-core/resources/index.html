<p>Resources describes your character’s general level of material wealth in the<br />
game world and ability to apply it. This might not always reflect cash on<br />
hand, given the different ways you can represent wealth in a particular<br />
setting—in a medieval game, it might be tied to land or vassals as much as<br />
gold; in the modern day, it might mean a number of good lines of credit.</p>
<p>This skill is in the default list to give you a basic, easy way to handle<br />
wealth as an abstraction without getting into minutiae or bookkeeping. Some<br />
people might consider it odd to give a static skill rating for something that<br />
we’re used to seeing as a finite resource.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: You can use Resources to get yourself<br />
out of or past any situation where throwing money at the problem will help,<br />
such as committing bribery or acquiring rare and expensive things. Challenges<br />
or contests might involve auctions or bidding wars.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: You might use Resources<br />
to grease the wheels and make people more friendly, whether that represents an<br />
actual bribe (<span class="aspect">I Scratch Your Back_..._</span>) or simply buying<br />
drinks for people (<span class="aspect">In Vino Veritas</span>). You can also use<br />
Resources to declare that you have something you need on hand, or can quickly<br />
acquire it, which could give you an aspect representing the object.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Resources isn’t used for attacks.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Resources isn’t used to defend.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Money Talks</strong>. You can use Resources instead of <a href="../../fate-core/rapport">Rapport</a> in any situation where ostentatious displays of material wealth might aid your cause.</li>
<li><strong>Savvy Investor</strong>. You get an additional free invoke when you create advantages with Resources, provided that they describe a monetary return on an investment you made in a previous session. (In other words, you can’t retroactively declare that you did it, but if it happened in the course of play, you get higher returns.)</li>
<li><strong>Trust Fund Baby</strong>. Twice per session, you may take a boost representing a windfall or influx of cash.</li>
</ul>

<p>If someone is using the Resources skill a bit too often, or you just want to<br />
represent how continually tapping into your source of wealth provides<br />
diminishing returns, you can try one of the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any time a character succeeds at a Resources roll, but doesn’t succeed with style, give them a situation aspect that reflects their temporary loss of wealth, like <span class="aspect">Thin Wallet</span> or <span class="aspect">Strapped for Cash</span>. If it happens again, just rename the aspect as something worse—<span class="aspect">Strapped for Cash</span> becomes <span class="aspect">Dead Broke</span>, <span class="aspect">Dead Broke</span> becomes <span class="aspect">Debt to Creditors</span>. The aspect is not a consequence, but it should make good compel fodder for characters who are shopping until they drop. It can go away if the character takes a break from spending cash, or at the end of the session.</li>
<li>Every time the character succeeds at a Resources roll, decrease the skill by one level for the remainder of that session. If they succeed at a Resources roll at Mediocre (+0), they can no longer make any Resources rolls that session.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you really want to get crazy, you can make finances a category of conflict<br />
and give each character a wealth stress track, giving them extra stress boxes<br />
for having a high Resources, but we don’t recommend going that far unless you<br />
plan on making material wealth a major part of your game.</p>

<p>The Resources skill is a one that some folks may want to tweak or modify. Ryan<br />
