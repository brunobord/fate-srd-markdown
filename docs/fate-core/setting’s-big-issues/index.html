<p>protagonists to action.</p>
<p>Every setting needs to have something going on that the characters care about,<br />
often a peril they want to fight or undermine. These are the setting’s issues.</p>
<p>You’ll come up with two issues as a group and write them down on index cards<br />
or a <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-
downloads/">game creation worksheet</a> (downloadable from Evil Hat). These issues are aspects and will be<br />
available to invoke or compel throughout the entirety of the game.</p>
<p>The issues should reflect the scale of your game and what the characters will<br />
face. They’re broad ideas; they don’t just affect your characters, but many<br />
people in the world. Issues take two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Issues:</strong> These are problems or threats that exist in the world already, possibly for a long time. Protagonists tackling these issues are trying to change the world, to make it a better place. Examples: a corrupt regime, organized crime, rampant poverty and disease, a generations-long war.</li>
<li><strong>Impending Issues:</strong> These are things that have begun to rear their ugly heads, and threaten to make the world worse if they come to pass or achieve a goal. Protagonists tackling these issues are trying to keep the world from slipping into chaos or destruction. Examples: an invasion from a neighboring country, the sudden rising of a zombie horde, the imposition of martial law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game and character creation involve <a href="../../fate-core
/making-good-aspect">making aspects</a>.</p>
<p>The default number of issues in a Fate game is two: Either two current issues<br />
(for a story solely about trying to make the world a better place), two<br />
impending issues (for a story about striving to save people from threats), or<br />
one of each. The latter option is common in fiction: think about the stalwart<br />
heroes who work against some impending doom while already discontent with the<br />
world around them.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-number-of-issues">Changing the Number of Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-number-of-issues" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Of course, you don’t have to use the default number of two issues if you don’t<br />
want to—one or three also works, but it will change the resulting game a bit.<br />
A game with one issue will revolve around just that issue—a quest to rid a<br />
city of evil, or to stop evil from happening. A game with three will show off<br />
a busy world, one where the characters’ resources are strained against<br />
multiple fronts. If you think you need to focus down or expand the scope of<br />
your game, talk it over with the group and start by tweaking the number of<br />
issues to best fit what you’re after.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The group thinks about the sort of problems they want to deal with in the<br />
world. Ryan immediately says “organized crime,” and they flesh that out a<br />
little. They come up with the idea of “The Scar Triad,” a group of thugs who<br />
are known for thievery, extortion, and other nasty things that the world could<br />
do without. This is clearly a current issue.</p>
<p>Lily wants the story to also be about something on the verge of happening,<br />
something Really Bad. They come up with an impending issue: a vile cult that<br />
seeks to summon something horrible into the world (which means they’re also<br />
saying that their setting includes horrible, Lovecraft-inspired things). Lenny<br />
calls it “The Doom that Is to Come,” and Ryan really likes this idea because<br />
it gives his bookish character a hook into things going on in the world.</p>

<h2 id="making-the-issues-into-aspects">Making the Issues into Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#making-the-issues-into-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As said earlier, issues are aspects. Turn the ideas you have into aspects that<br />
you could conceivably use at different times in the story (often as compels to<br />
the protagonists or as invocations for foes, but clever players will always<br />
find other uses for aspects). Write them down, and then if you need to add a<br />
little bit to remember the context or some details, write those down alongside<br />
the aspects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda writes down <span class="aspect">The Scar Triad</span> and <span class="aspect">The<br />
Doom that Is to Come</span> as two game aspects. She notes down next to The<br />
Scar Triad, “They’re into racketeering and other nasty stuff.” And with The<br />
Doom that Is to Come, “Led by the Cult of Tranquility.”</p>

<p>Led by the Cult of Tranquility.</p>
<p>If you’re new to making aspects, hold off on this for now. You’ll get quite a<br />
bit of practice making aspects for your characters. Once you’re done with<br />
character creation, turn these issue ideas into aspects.</p>
<h3 id="changing-issues-in-play">Changing Issues In Play<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-issues-in-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/long-game">The Long Game</a> section will talk about<br />
this in detail, but issues can change as the game progresses. Sometimes, the<br />
issue evolves into something new. Sometimes, the characters will successfully<br />
fight against it, and it’ll be gone. And sometimes, new issues will emerge. So<br />
the ones you make are just what you’re starting off with.</p>
<h2 id="drilling-down">Drilling Down<a class="headerlink" href="#drilling-down" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You can also use issues to flesh out smaller, but nonetheless important pieces<br />
of your setting. An important location (a major city or nation, or even a<br />
memorable local restaurant) or organization (a knightly order, a king’s court,<br />
or a corporation) can have impending and/or current issues as well.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you start by giving only one issue to each setting<br />
element, just to keep things from getting too bogged down, but you can always<br />
add more as the campaign progresses. Likewise, you don’t have to do this right<br />
now—if you find a setting element becoming more important later in the game,<br />
you can give it issues then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cult of Tranquility keeps popping up in pre-game discussions, so the<br />
group decides that it also needs an issue. After some discussion, the group<br />
decides it’d be interesting if there was some tension in the cult’s ranks, and<br />
makes a current issue called “Two Conflicting Prophecies”—different branches<br />
of the cult have different ideas of what the doom is going to be.</p>
