<p>Crafts is the skill of working with machinery, for good or ill.</p>
<p>The default skill is called Crafts because it’s what we use in the examples,<br />
but this skill might vary a great deal depending on the setting and what kind<br />
of technology is available. In a modern or sci-fi setting, this might be<br />
Engineering or Mechanics instead.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: Crafts allows you to build, break, or<br />
fix machinery, presuming you have the time and tools you need. Often, actions<br />
with Crafts happen as one component of a more complex situation, making it a<br />
popular skill for challenges. For example, if you’re just fixing a broken<br />
door, neither success nor failure is interesting; you should just succeed and<br />
move on. Now, if you’re trying to get your car to start while a pack of<br />
werewolves is hunting you…</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: You can use Crafts to<br />
create aspects representing features of a piece of machinery, pointing out<br />
useful features or strengths you can use to your advantage ([span:aspect<br />
]Armor-Plated</span>, <span class="aspect">Rugged Construction</span>) or a<br />
vulnerability for you to exploit (<span class="aspect">Flaw in the Cross-Beam</span>,<em><br />
</em><span class="aspect">Hasty Work</span>).</p>
<p>Creating Crafts advantages can also take the form of quick and dirty sabotage<br />
or jury-rigging on mechanical objects in the scene. For example, you might<br />
create a Makeshift Pulley to help you get to the platform above you, or throw<br />
something into the ballista that’s firing on you to give it a Jammed Pivoting<br />
Joint and make it harder to hit you.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: You probably won’t use Crafts to attack in<br />
a conflict, unless the conflict is specifically about using machinery, like<br />
with siege weaponry. GMs and players, talk over the likelihood of this<br />
happening in your game if you have someone who is really interested in taking<br />
this skill. Usually, weapons you craft are likely to be used with other skills<br />
to attack—a guy who makes a sword still needs Fight to wield it well!</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: As with attacking, Crafts doesn’t defend,<br />
unless you’re somehow using it as the skill to control a piece of machinery<br />
that you block with.</p>

<p>If working with different types of tech is important to your game, you might<br />
have several of these skills in your list. So, a futuristic game might have<br />
Engineering, Cybernetics, and Biotechnology, all basically with the same moves<br />
available for their respective type of tech. In such a game, an individual<br />
character can’t be proficient at all of them without expending a lot of skill<br />
ranks.</p>
<p>If you’re going to do this, make sure that you have a reason for it besides<br />
pedantry—if the only thing that splitting the skills gets you is the same<br />
effects with different names, you should keep it more generalized and use<br />
stunts to handle the specialties.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Always Making Useful Things</strong>. You don’t ever have to spend a fate point to declare that you have the proper tools for a particular job using Crafts, even in extreme situations (like being imprisoned and separated from all your stuff). This source of opposition is just off the table.</li>
<li><strong>Better than New!</strong> Whenever you succeed with style on an overcome action to repair a piece of machinery, you can immediately give it a new situation aspect (with a free invoke) reflecting the improvements you’ve made, instead of just a boost.</li>
<li><strong>Surgical Strikes</strong>. When using Crafts in a conflict involving machinery, you can filter out unwanted targets from whole-zone attacks without having to divide up your shifts (<a href="../../fate-core/challenges">normally, you’d need to divide your roll between your targets</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If building constructs and creating items is a big part of your game, check<br />
out <a href="../../fate-core/extras">Extras</a> for a discussion of what might<br />
result from the use of Crafts.</p>
