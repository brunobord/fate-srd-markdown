<p>At this point, you’ve probably got your issues figured out, and you may have<br />
thought of some organizations or groups that feature prominently in your game.</p>
<p>Now you have to put some faces on those issues and those groups, so that your<br />
PCs have people to interact with when they’re dealing with those elements. Do<br />
they have any particular people who represent them, or stand out as exemplars<br />
of what the issue’s referring to? If you have any ideas at this point, write<br />
them down on an index card: a name, a relationship to the organization or<br />
issue, and an aspect detailing their significance to the story.</p>
<p>Do the same for any notable places in your setting. Are there any important<br />
places where things happen, either important to the world, important to an<br />
issue, or important to the protagonists? If there’s a place where you envision<br />
multiple scenes taking place, then talk about that. Unlike NPCs, they don’t<br />
require aspects.</p>
<p>The GM may flesh these characters and places out later, depending on their<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/creating-and-playing-opposition" title="Creating the Opposition">role in the story</a>. Or one of these ideas might be a great<br />
inspiration for a protagonist! And, of course, new ones will unfold as the<br />
story progresses.</p>
<p>If there’s a piece of your setting that’s meant to be a <a href="../../fate-core/using-aspects-roleplaying" title="Using Aspects For Roleplaying">mystery</a><br />
which the protagonists uncover, define it only in loose terms. The specifics<br />
can be detailed as they are revealed in play.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a few minutes of discussion, the group writes down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Hugo the Charitable, a lieutenant in the Scar Triad. His aspect is<br />
<span class="aspect">Everyone in Riverton Fears Me</span>.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Which brings us to a place, the city of Riverton. There are two rivers<br />
here, so it’s a hub for trade.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Amanda comes up with a sympathetic character, Kale Westal, who owns a<br />
shop in Riverton. She isn’t cowed by Hugo’s extortion, and will likely fall<br />
victim to an “accident.” Her aspect is <span class="aspect">Stubborn Because I’m<br />
Right</span>.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Primarch, the leader of the Cult of Tranquility, whose identity is<br />
a mystery. Because that part of the setting is a mystery, they aren’t going to<br />
come up with an aspect or otherwise go any further, leaving those details to<br />
Amanda to figure out in secret.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They could go on, but they know they’ll have more ideas after character<br />
creation and as they play. That’s just enough to paint a picture of what’s<br />
going on at the very beginning of the story.</p>
