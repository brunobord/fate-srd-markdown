<h1 id="challenges">Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>A single overcome action is sufficient to deal with a straightforward goal or<br />
obstacle—the hero needs to pick this lock, disarm this bomb, sift out a vital<br />
piece of information, and so on. It’s also useful when the details of how<br />
something gets done aren’t important or worth spending an intense amount of<br />
time on, when what you need to know is whether the character can get something<br />
done without any setbacks or costs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, things get complicated. It’s not enough to pick the lock,<br />
because you also have to hold off the hordes of attacking zombies and set up<br />
the magical ward that’s going to keep pursuers off your back. It’s not enough<br />
to disarm the bomb, because you also have to land the crashing blimp and keep<br />
the unconscious scientist you’re rescuing from getting hurt in said landing.</p>
<p><strong>A challenge is a series of overcome actions that you use to resolve an especially complicated or dynamic situation.</strong> Each overcome action uses a different skill to deal with one task or part of the situation, and you take the individual results as a whole to figure out how the situation resolves.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-call-for-a-challenge">When To Call For A Challenge<a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-call-for-a-challenge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>GMs, when you’re trying to figure out if it’s appropriate to call for a<br />
challenge, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is each separate task something that can generate tension and drama independently of the other tasks?</strong> If all the tasks are really part of the same overall goal, like “detaching the detonator,” “stopping the timer”, and “disposing of the explosive material” when you’re disarming a bomb, then that should be one overcome action, where you use those details to explain what happened if the roll goes wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Does the situation require different skills to deal with?</strong> Holding off the zombies (Fight) while pushing down a barricade (Physique) and fixing your broken wagon (Crafts) so that you can get away would be a good instance for a challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-challenge">Setting Up A Challenge<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-challenge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To set up a challenge, simply identify the individual tasks or goals that make<br />
up the situation, and treat each one as a separate overcome roll. (Sometimes,<br />
only a certain sequence for the rolls will make sense to you; that’s okay<br />
too.) Depending on the situation, one character may be required to make<br />
several rolls, or multiple characters may be able to participate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zird the Arcane is attempting to finish the consecration ritual of the Qirik<br />
in order to sanctify the ground of the roadside inn and grant it the<br />
protection of the Qirik gods. Normally, this wouldn’t be too interesting,<br />
except that he’s trying to get it done before a horde of slavering, flesh-<br />
hungry zombies he unwittingly set free earlier in the adventure overruns the<br />
inn.</p>
<p>Amanda sees several different components to this scene. First there’s the<br />
ritual itself, then there’s keeping the inn boarded up, and finally there’s<br />
keeping the panicking inhabitants of the inn calm. That calls for Lore,<br />
Crafts, and some kind of social skill—Ryan immediately chooses Rapport.</p>
<p>Thus, Ryan will be rolling all three of those skills separately, one for<br />
each component Amanda identified. She sets the opposition for each of these at<br />
Good (+3)—she wants him to have even chances, while leaving room for a<br />
variable outcome.</p>
<p>Now they’re ready to start.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conducting-a-challenge">Conducting A Challenge<a class="headerlink" href="#conducting-a-challenge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To conduct a challenge, call for each overcome action in whichever order seems<br />
most interesting, but don’t decide anything about how the situation turns out<br />
until after you’ve collected all the results—you want to have the freedom to<br />
sequence the events of each roll in the order that makes the most sense and is<br />
the most entertaining. Players, if you get a boost on one of your rolls, feel<br />
free to use it on another roll in the challenge, provided you can justify it.</p>
<p>GMs, after the rolls have been made, you’ll consider the successes, failures,<br />
and costs of each action as you interpret how the scene proceeds. It could be<br />
that the results lead you into another challenge, a contest, or even a<br />
conflict.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ryan takes a deep breath and says, “All right, let’s do this.” He takes up<br />
the dice.</p>
<p>He decides to tackle securing the inn first, so he rolls his Good (+3)<br />
Crafts skill and gets a 0 on the dice. That ties the roll, allowing him to<br />
achieve the goal at a minor cost. Amanda says, “I’m going to say that I get a<br />
boost calledHasty Work to use against you if I need it—you are working fast,<br />
after all.”</p>
<p>Ryan sighs and nods, and then goes for the second goal in the challenge,<br />
which is calming the locals with his Good (+3) Rapport. He makes his roll and<br />
gets a terrible –3 on the dice! Now he has the option to fail or to succeed<br />
with a major cost. He goes for success, leaving Amanda to think of a good<br />
major cost.</p>
<p>She thinks a moment. How to make calming the villagers costly? Then she<br />
grins. “So, this is a story thing more than a mechanics thing, but you know…<br />
you’re using Rapport, so you’re probably being pretty inspirational right now.<br />
I could see you inadvertently convincing some of these farmers and peasants<br />
that those zombies are no real threat, and that they totally can go out and<br />
fight with little consequence. Because your magic is keeping them safe,<br />
right?”</p>
<p>Ryan says, “But they have to be in the inn for that to work!” Amanda is just<br />
grinning. Ryan sighs again. “Okay, fine. Some people get totally the wrong<br />
idea and are potentially going to get themselves killed. I can just hear them<br />
now… Zird, why did you let my husband die? Augh.”</p>
<p>Amanda grins some more.</p>
<p>Ryan goes for the final part of the challenge—the ritual itself, cast with<br />
his Great (+4) Lore. Amanda invokes the boost she got earlier and says, “Yeah,<br />
you totally have very distracting zombies chipping apart your barricades. Very<br />
distracting.” That pushes the difficulty for the final roll up to Superb (+5).</p>
<p>He rolls a +2 and gets a Fantastic (+6), enough to succeed with no cost.</p>
<p>Amanda nods and together they finish describing the scene—Zird finishes the<br />
ritual just in time, and the holy power of the Qirik descends on the inn. Some<br />
zombies on the verge of breaking in get sizzled by the holy aura, and Zird<br />
breathes a sigh of relief… until he hears the panicked screams of villagers<br />
outside the inn…</p>
<p>But that’s the next scene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have any boosts that went unused in the challenge, feel free to keep<br />
them for the rest of this scene or whatever scene you’re transitioning to, if<br />
the events of the challenge connect directly to the next scene.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-in-a-challenge">Advantages in a Challenge<a class="headerlink" href="#advantages-in-a-challenge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You can try to create an advantage during a challenge, for yourself or to help<br />
someone else out. Creating an advantage doesn’t count towards completing one<br />
of the challenge goals, but failing the roll could create a cost or problem<br />
that negatively impacts one of the other goals. Be careful using this tactic;<br />
advantages can help complete tasks more effectively and create momentum, but<br />
trying to create them is not without risk.</p>
<h2 id="attacks-in-a-challenge">Attacks in a Challenge<a class="headerlink" href="#attacks-in-a-challenge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Because you’re always up against passive opposition in a challenge, you’ll<br />
never use the attack action. If you’re in a situation where it seems<br />
reasonable to roll an attack, you should start setting up for a conflict.</p>
