<p><strong>Determine how much of a beating your character can take.</strong></p>
<p>When Fate characters find themselves in harm’s way—a fairly common occurrence<br />
when you’re highly competent, proactive, and facing drama at every turn—they<br />
have two ways to stand their ground and stay on their feet: <strong>stress</strong> and<br />
<strong>consequences</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../fate-core/conflicts">Conflicts</a> section of the Challenges,<br />
Contests, and Conflicts section fully explains what these mean and how they’re<br />
used. In brief, stress represents the ephemeral toll of participating in a<br />
conflict, whereas consequences are the lingering effects, and sometimes quite<br />
traumatic ones, of taking harm.</p>
<h2 id="stress-tracks">Stress Tracks<a class="headerlink" href="#stress-tracks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Every PC has two different <a href="../../fate-core/stress-
consequences" title="Stress &amp; Consequences">stress tracks</a>. The physical stress track deals with<br />
physical harm, and the mental stress track mitigates mental harm. The more<br />
boxes in a stress track, the more resilient the character is in that regard.<br />
By default, a character has two boxes in each stress track.</p>
<h2 id="consequence-slots">Consequence Slots<a class="headerlink" href="#consequence-slots" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Every PC also has three <a href="../../fate-core/stress-
consequences">consequence slots</a>. One is mild, one is moderate, and the last one is severe.<br />
Unlike stress, these aren’t classified as either physical or mental—any of<br />
them can apply to any type of harm. As mentioned above, consequences are the<br />
injuries and traumas you can’t just shake off after the dust settles.</p>
<h2 id="adding-tracks-and-slots">Adding Tracks and Slots<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-tracks-and-slots" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Certain skills and some stunts can add to these defaults. See the <a href="../../fate-core/skills-stunts" title="Skills &amp; Stunts">Skills and<br />
Stunts</a> section for<br />
more on that. For the sake of quick reference, these are the skills in <em>Hearts<br />
of Steel</em> that alter stress and consequences:</p>
<p><a href="../../fate-core/physique">Physique</a> helps with physical stress, and<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/will">Will</a> helps with mental stress. Either skill<br />
grants one more stress box of the respective type (physical or mental) if<br />
rated at Average (+1) or Fair (+2), or two more stress boxes if rated at Good<br />
(+3) or higher. At Superb (+5) or higher, they also grant an additional mild<br />
consequence slot. Unlike the standard three, this consequence slot is<br />
specifically restricted to either physical harm (Physique) or mental harm<br />
(Will).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you’re playing in a setting with different skills, the skills that affect stress boxes and consequences may change. Take a note of those skill benefits when you’re making your character.</p>
<p>You can add stress tracks if the characters in your game suffer unique kinds<br />
of harm, such as <a href="../../fate-core/more-examples-
extras">wealth stress</a> in a very political game. Changing the number of boxes will slow down<br />
and draw out conflicts, which may be more appropriate for high-octane, pulpy<br />
genres where characters are expected to take a lot of hits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landon has Good (+3) Physique, which nets him two more physical stress<br />
boxes. His Will, however, is only Average (+1), but that’s still good enough<br />
for one more mental stress box.</p>
<p>Cynere’s Physique is Fair (+2), so she gets a third physical stress box. But<br />
her mental stress track remains at two boxes, thanks to her Mediocre (+0)<br />
Will.</p>
<p>Zird the Arcane, being a rather bookish type, has Mediocre (+0) Physique, so<br />
he has only the default physical stress track of two boxes. His Fair (+2)<br />
Will, though, is good for one bonus mental stress box.</p>
<p>Because none of these characters has Physique or Will rated at Superb (+5)<br />
or above, each has the default number of consequences: one mild, one moderate,<br />
and one severe.</p>
