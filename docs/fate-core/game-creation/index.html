<p>You can use Fate to tell stories in many different genres, with a variety of<br />
premises. There is no default setting; you and your group will make that up<br />
yourselves. The very best Fate games, however, have certain ideas in common<br />
with one another, which best showcases what the game is designed to do.</p>
<p>Whether you’re talking about fantasy, science fiction, superheroes, or gritty<br />
cop shows, Fate works best when you use it to tell stories about people who<br />
are <em>proactive</em>, <em>competent</em>, and <em>dramatic</em>.</p>
<h2 id="proactivity">Proactivity<a class="headerlink" href="#proactivity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Characters in a game of Fate should be proactive. They have a variety of<br />
abilities that lend themselves to active problem solving, and they aren’t<br />
timid about using them. They don’t sit around waiting for the solution to a<br />
crisis to come to them—they go out and apply their energies, taking risks and<br />
overcoming obstacles to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that they don’t ever plan or strategize, or that they’re all<br />
careless to a fault. It just means that even the most patient among them will<br />
eventually rise and take action in a tangible, demonstrable way.</p>
<p>Any Fate game you play should give a clear opportunity for the characters to<br />
be proactive in solving their problems, and have a variety of ways they might<br />
go about it. A game about librarians spending all their time among dusty tomes<br />
and learning things isn’t Fate. A game about librarians_ using forgotten<br />
knowledge to save the world is_.</p>
<h2 id="competence">Competence<a class="headerlink" href="#competence" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Characters in a game of Fate are good at things. They aren’t bumbling fools<br />
who routinely look ridiculous when they’re trying to get things done—they’re<br />
highly skilled, talented, or trained individuals who are capable of making<br />
visible change in the world they inhabit. They are the right people for the<br />
job, and they get involved in a crisis because they have a good chance of<br />
being able to resolve it for the better.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean they always succeed, or that their actions are without<br />
unintended consequence. It just means that when they fail, it isn’t because<br />
they made dumb mistakes or weren’t prepared for the risks.</p>
<p>Any Fate game that you play should treat the characters like competent people,<br />
worthy of the risks and challenges that come their way. A game about garbage<br />
men who are forced to fight supervillains and get their asses constantly<br />
handed to them isn’t Fate. A game about garbage men who <em>become an awesome<br />
anti-supervillain hit squad is</em>.</p>
<h2 id="drama">Drama<a class="headerlink" href="#drama" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Characters in a game of Fate lead dramatic lives. The stakes are always high<br />
for them, both in terms of what they have to deal with in their world, and<br />
what they’re dealing with in the six inches of space between their ears. Like<br />
us, they have interpersonal troubles and struggle with their issues, and<br />
though the external circumstances of their lives might be a lot bigger in<br />
scope than what we go through, we can still relate to and sympathize with<br />
them.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean they spend all their time wallowing in misery and pain, or<br />
that everything in their lives is always a world-shaking crisis. It just means<br />
that their lives require them to make hard choices and live with the<br />
consequences—in other words, that they’re essentially human.</p>
<p>Any Fate game that you play should provide the potential and opportunity for<br />
drama among and between the characters, and give you a chance to relate to<br />
them as people. A game about adventurers mindlessly punching increasing<br />
numbers of bigger, badder bad guys is not Fate. A game about adventurers<br />
<em>struggling to lead normal lives despite being destined to fight ultimate evil<br />
is</em>.</p>
