<p>As outlined in <a href="../../fate-core/game-creation">Game Creation</a>,<br />
inventing or deciding on a setting is often a collaborative effort between you<br />
and your players. In that sense, the best thing you can do as GM during the<br />
game-creation process is to be open to new ideas and be generous with your<br />
own, just like everyone else. Play off of and expand upon the suggestions that<br />
the others offer up. Your players will be more invested in the game if they<br />
feel like they’ve had a hand in building it.</p>
<p>Of course, if everyone’s amenable, there’s nothing stopping you from showing<br />
up with a clear vision of exactly what you want to run. “Okay, this is going<br />
to be a game about the Cold War in the ‘60s, except it’s all steampunk and<br />
mechs. Go!” Just make sure everyone’s on board if you go that route. Even one<br />
player who isn’t into it, and doesn’t really feel inclined to get into it, can<br />
really affect the game.</p>
<h2 id="out-there-vs-down-here">Out There vs. Down Here<a class="headerlink" href="#out-there-vs-down-here" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of steampunk mechs in a ‘60s-era Soviet Union, it’s a good idea to<br />
consider just how “out there” you want to get. High-concept ideas are a lot of<br />
fun, but if they’re too difficult to relate to then your players may have<br />
trouble wrapping their heads around the game you’re proposing. Where that line<br />
is exactly will vary from group to group (and player to player), so there’s no<br />
definitive answer here. Just be aware that every departure from the<br />
familiar—whether that’s the real world or well-established genre<br />
conventions—has the potential to be a conceptual hurdle for your players. Get<br />
everyone on the same page and make sure to go over any questions in advance.</p>
<p>The opposite approach is to set the game down here, in the real world, with<br />
perhaps only one or two notable departures with greater ramifications that you<br />
can explore as you go. The easiest way to communicate a setting like this is<br />
to name a time and place you’re all familiar with, then tack on the exception.<br />
For example, “It’s like modern-day London, but robots are commonplace” or<br />
“It’s post-World War II Los Angeles, but some returning veterans have<br />
supernatural powers.”</p>
<h2 id="top-down-vs-bottom-up">Top Down vs. Bottom Up<a class="headerlink" href="#top-down-vs-bottom-up" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There’s also the matter of how broad the scope of the game will be. Some like<br />
to start with the big picture first and drill down to the details, while<br />
others prefer to start with the here and now and develop the big picture as<br />
they go. These are often called “top down” and “bottom up,” respectively.<br />
Neither one’s better than the other, but each has its pros and cons.</p>
<p>With the top-down approach, you’ll determine most of the setting in<br />
advance—stuff like who the movers and shakers are, the locations of important<br />
cities, the nature of important organizations, and so on. This has the<br />
advantage of providing a clear sense of how the world fits together. For<br />
example, if you’ve decided that the Kingdom of Talua is in a perpetual state<br />
of conflict between five powerful Houses vying for control, then you know<br />
right away that anyone of note in the kingdom is likely to come from one of<br />
those Houses—and if they aren’t, it’ll have to be for a very good reason.</p>
<p>The downside, of course, is that unless you’re working from a pre-existing<br />
setting from a movie, TV show, book, video game, or whatever, it’s usually a<br />
lot of work on the front end. It also requires the players to show up with a<br />
pretty thorough understanding of it all, which can be daunting. But if<br />
everyone’s up to speed, it can make for a very enjoyable and rewarding game.</p>
<p>If you’re going bottom-up, though, you’ll start with whatever’s immediately<br />
important to the PCs. That might be anything from a few notable NPCs in their<br />
hometown to the name of the guy who works in the next cubicle over. Then the<br />
group figures out the details as the story goes along. There’s no need to have<br />
an idea of how things fit into the world, because everyone will make that up<br />
as you go. The world just spirals out from whatever you start with.</p>
<p>The potential downside here is that it requires quite a bit of improvisation<br />
and thinking on your feet. That goes for everyone at the table, GM and players<br />
alike. For you, the GM, that might not be such a big deal—running a game<br />
almost always involves a degree of flying by the seat of one’s pants—but not<br />
all players are going to be ready for that sort of responsibility. In<br />
addition, if your players like to immerse themselves in their characters and<br />
see the game world through their eyes, they may find it jarring to<br />
occasionally break from that perspective to, say, invent a name on the spot<br />
for the enchanted axe they just found or tell you what happened to the last<br />
Shadow Director of the CIA.</p>
<p>Fate can handle either, but the system’s support for player-driven<br />
contributions to the narrative in the form of aspects and story details really<br />
makes the bottom-up method sing. If that’s the way you like to play anyway,<br />
great! If not, no pressure—but give it a try sometime.</p>
<h2 id="small-scale-vs-large-scale">Small Scale vs. Large Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#small-scale-vs-large-scale" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There’s already been some discussion of <a href="../../fate-
core/game%E2%80%99s-scale" title="Game Scale">game scale</a> in Game Creation, but it’s worth a<br />
little more discussion.</p>
<p>As laid out in that section, small-scale stories concern events closely<br />
connected to the PCs, and probably within a very limited geographical area.<br />
Large-scale games are the opposite: epic tales spanning nations, planets, or<br />
galaxies with world(s)-shaking consequences. Both types of stories can be a<br />
lot of fun—winning the title of Grand Emperor of the Galactic Reach can be<br />
just as rewarding as winning the hand of the prettiest girl in the village.</p>
<p>However, don’t be fooled into thinking the two are mutually exclusive. Here<br />
are a couple ways to combine them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start Small and Grow</strong>: This is the classic zero-to-hero story in which an unassuming individual with no pretensions to glory is suddenly swept up in events beyond the scope of his experience. Consider Luke Skywalker in Star Wars: A New Hope. He starts off a nobody moisture farmer, racing T-16s and getting up to the odd bit of mischief at Tosche Station. Then a pair of droids come into his life and inject a little mystery: Who’s this Obi-Wan Kenobi? Before he knows it, he’s consorting with smugglers, rescuing a princess, and striking a blow for the Rebellion. It’s a classic case of starting small-scale and expanding into a large-scale story.</li>
<li><strong>Peaks and Valleys</strong>: Here, you’re alternating the large-scale with the small, using the latter almost as something of a breather. Typically, the large-scale storylines will deal with matters of state, the conquering of planets, the banishing of unthinkable Beings From Beyond, and the like, while the small-scale storylines will be of a more personal nature, with few if any connections to the earth-shaking events transpiring in the characters’ lives. For example, you might spend a session or two tussling with that Grand Emperor, then change focus to a character reconnecting with her father or coming to the aid of a friend in need. The small-scale sessions serve as something of a breather between all that epic action, and give the players a chance to delve into some unexplored corners of their characters. Plus, if you want to connect the small- and large-scale stories down the line, you can—and the payoff will be all the more satisfying for the players.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does your setting require things like superpowers, magic, high-tech gadgetry,<br />
or something else that falls outside the confines of the mundane? Either way,<br />
you’re going to want to figure that out now, before play begins. See the<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/extras" title="Extras">Extras</a> section for more on what<br />
extras are and how you can make use of them in your game.</p>
