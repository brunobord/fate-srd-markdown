<p>Finally, aspects have a passive use that you can draw on in almost every<br />
instance of play. Players, you can use them as a guide to roleplaying your<br />
character. This may seem self-evident, but it should be called out anyway—the<br />
aspects on your character sheet are true of your character <em>at all times</em>, not<br />
just when they’re invoked or compelled.</p>
<p>Think of your collection of aspects as an oracle—like a tarot spread or tea<br />
leaves. They give you a big picture of what your character’s about, and they<br />
can reveal interesting implications if you read between the lines. If you’re<br />
wondering what your character might do in a certain situation, look at your<br />
aspects. What do they say about your character’s personality, goals, and<br />
desires? Are there any clues in what your aspects say that might suggest a<br />
course of action? Once you find that suggestion, go for it.</p>
<p>Playing to your aspects also has another benefit: you’re feeding the GM ideas<br />
for compels. You’re already bringing your aspects into the game, so all she<br />
has to do is offer you complications and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>GMs, you’ll use your NPCs aspects the same way, but you get an additional way<br />
of “reading the tea leaves”—you can also use them as a way of figuring out how<br />
the world reacts to the characters. Does someone have the aspect<br />
<span class="aspect">Strongest Man in the World</span>? That’s a reputation that might<br />
precede that character, one that people might know about and react to. People<br />
might crowd in to see that character when he’s passing through.</p>
<p>Also, it suggests something about that character’s physical size and build.<br />
You know that most people are going to give that character a wide berth in a<br />
crowded space, might be naturally intimidated, or might be overly aggressive<br />
or brusque as overcompensation for being intimidated.</p>
<p>But no one’s going to ignore that character. Inserting these kinds of aspect-<br />
related details into your narration can help your game seem more vivid and<br />
consistent, even when you’re not shuffling fate points around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a session of Hearts of Steel, Landon comes back to his home village of<br />
Vinfeld, only to find that it has been sacked by barbarians and that his<br />
mentor, Old Finn, has been kidnapped.</p>
<p>Amanda tells him that the other villagers are overjoyed that he’s come back,<br />
and in a scene where he talks to the village elders, she also says that they<br />
want him to stay and help with rebuilding the town.</p>
<p>Lenny looks at some of the aspects on Landon’s sheet: <span class="aspect">Disciple<br />
of the Ivory Shroud</span>, <span class="aspect">I Owe Old Finn Everything</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat</span>, and <span class="aspect">Smashing is Always<br />
an Option</span>. His read of those aspects is that they show Landon as being<br />
very straightforward (to the point of rudeness), aggressive, inclined to solve<br />
problems through violence, and very loyal to those he considers his own.</p>
<p>Because of his aspects, there’s not a prayer’s chance in hell Landon’s going<br />
to stay and help the town when Finn might still be alive. And not only that,<br />
he’s going to tell the elders exactly how he feels about the fact that they<br />
didn’t send a rescue party after Old Finn themselves. Probably he uses words<br />
like “spineless” and “worthless.” You know, words that really make people<br />
sympathize with you.</p>
<p>Amanda says that he enrages the elders so much that they’re pondering<br />
banishing him from town for his insolence. She holds up a fate point and<br />
grins, indicating a compel—his manners are going to get him kicked out of<br />
Vinfeld.</p>
<p>Lenny takes it, accepting that complication. “Screw them anyway,” he says.<br />
“I’ll rescue Finn without their help.”</p>

<p>Game and character aspects change through advancement. See the <a href="../../fate-core/advancement-change" title="Milestones">Milestones<br />
</a> section for that.</p>
<p>If you want to get rid of a situation aspect, you can do it in one of two<br />
ways: roll an overcome action specifically for the purpose of getting rid of<br />
the aspect, or roll some other kind of action that would make the aspect make<br />
no sense if you succeed. (For example, if you’re <span class="aspect">Grappled</span>,<br />
you could try to sprint away. If you succeed, it wouldn’t make sense for you<br />
to be <span class="aspect">Grappled</span> anymore, so you’d also get rid of that<br />
aspect.)</p>
<p>If a character can interfere with your action, they get to roll active<br />
opposition against you as per normal. Otherwise, GMs, it’s your job to set<br />
passive opposition or just allow the player to get rid of the aspect without a<br />
roll, if there’s nothing risky or interesting in the way.</p>
<p>Finally, if at any point it simply makes no sense for a situation aspect to be<br />
in play, get rid of it.</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-discovering-new-aspects-in-play">Creating and Discovering New Aspects In Play<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-discovering-new-aspects-in-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In addition to your character aspects, game aspects, and the situation aspects<br />
that the GM presents, you have the ability to create, discover, or gain access<br />
to other aspects as you play.</p>
<p>For the most part, you’ll use the <a href="../../fate-
core/four-actions" title="Create An Advantage">create an advantage</a> action to make new aspects. When you<br />
describe the action that gives you an advantage, the context should tell you<br />
if it requires a new aspect or if it derives from an existing one. If you’re<br />
bringing a new circumstance into play—like throwing sand in someone’s<br />
eyes—you’re indicating that you need a new situation aspect.</p>
<p>With some skills, it’s going to make more sense to stick an advantage to an<br />
aspect that’s already on some other character’s sheet. In this case, the PC or<br />
NPC you’re targeting would provide active opposition to keep you from being<br />
able to use that aspect.</p>
<p>If you’re not looking for a free invocation, and you just think it’d make<br />
sense if there were a particular situation aspect in play, you don’t need to<br />
roll the dice or anything to make new aspects—just suggest them, and if the<br />
group thinks they’re interesting, write them down.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-gm-extremely-powerful-ninja-gm-trick">For the GM: Extremely Powerful Ninja GM Trick<a class="headerlink" href="#for-the-gm-extremely-powerful-ninja-gm-trick" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>So, if you don’t have any aspects made up for a scene or an NPC, just ask the<br />
players what kinds of aspects they’re looking for when they roll to create an<br />
advantage. If they tie or succeed, just write down something similar to what<br />
they were looking for and say they were right. If they fail, write it down<br />
anyway, or write another aspect down that’s not advantageous to them, so as to<br />
contrast with their expectations.</p>
<h2 id="secret-or-hidden-aspects">Secret or Hidden Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#secret-or-hidden-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Some skills also let you use the create an advantage action to reveal aspects<br />
that are hidden, either on NPCs or environments—in this case, the GM simply<br />
tells you what the aspect is if you get a tie or better on the roll. You can<br />
use this to “fish” for aspects if you’re not precisely sure what to look<br />
for—doing well on the roll is sufficient justification for being able to find<br />
something advantage-worthy.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is assumed that most of the aspects in play are public<br />
knowledge for the players. The PCs’ character sheets are sitting on the table,<br />
and probably the main and supporting NPCs are as well. That doesn’t always<br />
mean the characters know about those aspects, but that’s one of the reasons<br />
why the create an advantage action exists—to help you justify how a character<br />
learns about other characters.</p>
<p>Also, remember that aspects can help deepen the story only if you get to use<br />
them—aspects that are never discovered might as well never have existed in the<br />
first place. So most of the time, the players should always know what aspects<br />
are available for their use, and if there’s a question as to whether or not<br />
the character knows, use the dice to help you decide.</p>
<p>Finally, sometimes you’re going to want to keep an NPC’s aspects secret or not<br />
reveal certain situation aspects right away because you’re trying to build<br />
tension in the story. If the PCs are investigating a series of murders, you<br />
don’t exactly want the culprit to have <span class="aspect">Sociopathic Serial<br />
Murderer</span> sitting on an index card for the PCs to see at the beginning<br />
of the adventure.</p>
<p>In those cases, it is recommended that you don’t make an aspect directly out<br />
of whatever fact you’re trying to keep secret. Instead, make the aspect a<br />
detail that makes sense in context after the secret is revealed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda is making an NPC who’s secretly a vampire, the main bad guy in the<br />
scenario she’s planning. He’s also a constable in the town the PCs are going<br />
to, so she doesn’t want to give things away too easily.</p>
<p>Instead of making a <span class="aspect">Secretly a Vampire</span> aspect, she<br />
decides to make a few personal details instead: <span class="aspect">Inveterate Night<br />
Owl</span>, <span class="aspect">Tougher Than He Looks</span>, and <span class="aspect">Wheels<br />
Within Wheels</span>. If the PCs discover a couple of these, or see them on<br />
the table, they might start to suspect the NPC, but it’s not going to ruin the<br />
mystery of the scenario right away.</p>
