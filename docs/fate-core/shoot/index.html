<p>The counterpart to <a href="../../fate-core/fight">Fight</a>, Shoot is the skill<br />
of using ranged weaponry, either in a conflict or on targets that don’t<br />
actively resist your attempts to shoot them (like a bull’s-eye or the broad<br />
side of a barn).</p>
<p>Again, as with Fight, if it’s important to your setting to make a distinction<br />
between different types of ranged weaponry, you might separate this out into<br />
skills like Bows, Guns, Energy Weapons, etc. Don’t go nuts with this unless<br />
it’s key to your game.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: Unless, for some reason, you need to<br />
demonstrate your Shoot ability in a non-conflict situation, you probably won’t<br />
be using this skill for normal obstacles much. Obviously, contests involving<br />
Shoot are a popular staple of adventure fiction, and we recommend you look for<br />
the opportunity to have them if you have a character who specializes in this.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: In physical conflicts,<br />
Shoot can be used to perform a wide variety of moves, like trick shots,<br />
keeping someone under heavy fire, and the like. In cinematic games, you might<br />
even be able to disarm people and pin their sleeves to walls—pretty much<br />
anything you’ve seen in an action movie. You could also make the argument for<br />
creating aspects based on your knowledge of guns (like placing a<br />
<span class="aspect">Prone to Jams</span> aspect on an opponent’s gun).</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: This skill makes physical attacks. You can<br />
make them from up to two zones away, unlike with Fight. (Sometimes the range<br />
will change with the weapon.)</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Shoot is unique in that it doesn’t really<br />
have a defense component to it—you’d use Athletics for that. You could use it<br />
to lay down some covering fire—which might act as a defense for your allies or<br />
provide opposition to someone else’s movement—though it could just as easily<br />
be represented by creating an advantage (<span class="aspect">Covering Fire</span> or<br />
<span class="aspect">Hail of Bullets</span>, for example).</p>
<h2 id="shoot-stunts">Shoot Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#shoot-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Called Shot</strong>. During a Shoot attack, spend a fate point and declare a specific condition you want to inflict on a target, like Shot in the Hand. If you succeed, you place that as a situation aspect on them in addition to hitting them for stress.</li>
<li><strong>Quick on the Draw</strong>. You can use Shoot instead of Notice to determine turn order in any physical conflict where shooting quickly would be useful.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uncanny Accuracy</strong>. Once per conflict, stack an additional free invoke on an advantage you’ve created to represent the time you take to aim or line up a shot (like In My Sights).</p>
