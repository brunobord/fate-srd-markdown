<h2 id="invoking-aspects">Invoking Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#invoking-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The primary way you’re going to use aspects in a game of Fate is to invoke<br />
them. If you’re in a situation where an aspect is beneficial to your character<br />
somehow, you can invoke it.</p>
<p>In order to invoke an aspect, explain why the aspect is relevant, spend a<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/fate-points" title="Fate Points">fate point</a>, and you can<br />
choose one of these benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a +2 on your current skill roll after you’ve rolled the dice.</li>
<li>Reroll all your dice.</li>
<li>Pass a +2 benefit to another character’s roll, if it’s reasonable that the aspect you’re invoking would be able to help.</li>
<li>Add +2 to any source of passive opposition, if it’s reasonable that the aspect you’re invoking could contribute to making things more difficult. You can also use this to create passive opposition at Fair (+2) if there wasn’t going to be any.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-reroll-vs-the-2">The Reroll Vs. The +2<a class="headerlink" href="#the-reroll-vs-the-2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Rerolling the dice is a little riskier than just getting the +2 bonus, but has<br />
the potential for greater benefit. We recommend you reserve this option for<br />
when you’ve rolled a –3 or a –4 on the dice, to maximize the chance that<br />
you’ll get a beneficial result from rerolling. <a href="../../fate-core/taking-action-dice-ladder#the-math-behind-the-
dice">The odds are better that way<br />
</a>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter when you invoke the aspect, but usually it’s best to wait<br />
until after you’ve rolled the dice to see if you’re going to need the benefit.<br />
You can invoke multiple aspects on a single roll, but you cannot invoke the<br />
same aspect multiple times on a single roll. So if your reroll doesn’t help<br />
you enough, you’ll have to pick another aspect (and spend another fate point)<br />
for a second reroll or that +2.</p>
<p>The group has to buy into the relevance of a particular aspect when you invoke<br />
it; GMs, you’re the final arbiter on this one. The use of an aspect should<br />
make sense, or you should be able to creatively narrate your way into ensuring<br />
it makes sense.</p>
<p>Precisely how you do this is up to you. Sometimes, it makes so much sense to<br />
use a particular aspect that you can just hold up the fate point and name it.<br />
Or you might need to embellish your character’s action a little more so that<br />
everyone understands where you’re coming from. (That’s why it is recommended<br />
that you make sure that you’re on the same page with the group as to what each<br />
of your aspects means—it makes it easier to justify bringing it into play.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landon is trying to win a contest of wits with a rival in a tavern, and the<br />
skill they’re currently using is Rapport, which they’ve described as<br />
“attempting to shame each other as politely as possible.”</p>
<p>Lenny rolls badly on one of the contest exchanges, and says, “I want to<br />
invoke <span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat</span>.” Amanda gives him a<br />
skeptical look and replies, “What happened to ‘as politely as possible’?”</p>
<p>Lenny says, “Well, what I was thinking about doing was making some kind of<br />
ribald but not vulgar innuendo about the guy’s parentage, in order to get the<br />
crowd at the bar to laugh at him, perhaps despite themselves. I figure that<br />
bawdy put-downs are precisely my cup of tea.”</p>
<p>Amanda nods and says, “Okay, I’ll take that.”</p>
<p>Lenny spends the fate point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to see more examples of invoking an aspect, they've been scattered<br />
them throughout the book—they’re so integral to how Fate works that they<br />
naturally end up in many examples of play.</p>
<p>If the aspect you invoke is on someone else’s character sheet, including<br />
situation aspects attached to them, and the invoke is to their disadvantage,<br />
you give them the fate point you spent. (Invoking a third party’s aspect is<br />
treated just like invoking an unattached situation aspect.) They don’t<br />
actually get to use it until after the end of the scene, though.</p>
<h3 id="the-ellipsis-trick">The Ellipsis Trick<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ellipsis-trick" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you want an easy way to ensure you have room to incorporate aspects into a<br />
roll, try narrating your action with an ellipsis at the end (“...”), and then<br />
finish the action with the aspect you want to invoke. Like this:</p>
<p>Lily says, “Okay, so I raise my sword up and...” (rolls dice, hates the<br />
result) “...and it looks like I’m going to miss at first, but it turns out to<br />
be a quick feint-and-slash, a classic move from the <span class="aspect">Infamous Girl<br />
with Sword</span>” (spends the fate point).</p>
<p>Ryan says, “So I’m trying to decipher the runes in the book and...” (rolls the<br />
dice, hates the result) “...and <span class="aspect">If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve<br />
Read About It</span>...” (spends a fate point) “...and I easily start rambling<br />
about their origin.”</p>
<h3 id="free-invocations">Free Invocations<a class="headerlink" href="#free-invocations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You don’t always have to pay a fate point to invoke an aspect—sometimes it’s<br />
free.</p>
<p>When you succeed at <a href="../../fate-core/four-
actions" title="Creating An Advantage">creating an advantage</a>, you “stick” a free invocation onto an<br />
aspect. If you succeed with style, you get two invocations. Some of the other<br />
actions also give you free boosts.</p>
<p>You also get to stick a free invocation on any consequences you inflict in a<br />
conflict.</p>
<p>Free invocations work like normal ones except in two ways: no fate points are<br />
exchanged, and you can stack them with a normal invocation for a better bonus.<br />
So you can use a free invocation and pay a fate point on the same aspect to<br />
get a +4 bonus instead of a +2, two rerolls instead of one, or you can add +4<br />
to another character’s roll or increase passive opposition by +4. Or you could<br />
split the benefits, getting a reroll and a +2 bonus. You can also stack<br />
multiple free invocations together.</p>
<p>After you’ve used your free invocation, if the aspect in question is still<br />
around, you can keep invoking it by spending fate points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere succeeds on an attack, and causes her opponent to take the<br />
<span class="aspect">Cut Across the Gut</span> consequence. On the next exchange, she<br />
attacks him again, and she can invoke that for free because she put it there,<br />
giving her a +2 or a reroll.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want, you can pass your free invocation to another character. That<br />
allows you to get some teamwork going between you and a buddy. This is really<br />
useful in a conflict if you want to set someone up for a big blow—have<br />
everyone create an advantage and pass their free invocations onto one person,<br />
then that person stacks all of them up at once for a huge bonus.</p>
<h3 id="for-veterans">For Veterans<a class="headerlink" href="#for-veterans" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In other Fate games, free invocations were called “tagging.” This was one bit<br />
of jargon too many. You can still call it that if you want—whatever helps you<br />
and your table understand the rule.</p>
<h3 id="hostile-invocations-excerpted-from-fateful-concepts-hacking-contests">Hostile Invocations (Excerpted from <em>Fateful Concepts: Hacking Contests</em>)<a class="headerlink" href="#hostile-invocations-excerpted-from-fateful-concepts-hacking-contests" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Whenever you invoke another player character’s aspects against them—notably<br />
but not only consequences—that’s a <strong>hostile invocation</strong>, and that<br />
character’s player gets the fate point. This rule is an important part of Fate<br />
because it’s a way to give a player fate points. But this doesn’t just count<br />
for character aspects! If there’s an aspect effectively attached to or<br />
controlled by a PC, like some aspect-worthy gear they’re holding or an<br />
advantage they created, and it’s invoked against that character, that’s a<br />
hostile invocation.</p>
<p>If that aspect isn’t invoked directly against the character, but the action<br />
works against that character’s interests (which is generally the only reason<br />
you could invoke someone else’s aspect), that player still gets the fate<br />
point. This rule is key to remember when one player hostilely invokes<br />
another’s aspect.</p>
<p>Fate points from hostile invocations can’t be spent on the situation where<br />
they’re gained. They’re available starting on the next scene. (Otherwise, you<br />
could just spend back and forth and draw a contest out by invoking and<br />
counter-invoking each other.) Oh, and usually everyone can invoke<br />
<span class="aspect">On Fire</span> even if one character deliberately created it as<br />
an advantage, because no one actually controls that aspect. (Unless you’re<br />
talking about magic or something else that grants control, hence “usually.”)</p>

<h2 id="compelling-aspects">Compelling Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#compelling-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The other way you use aspects in the game is called a <strong>compel</strong>. If you’re in<br />
a situation where having or being around a certain aspect means your<br />
character’s life is more dramatic or complicated, someone can compel the<br />
aspect. That aspect can be on your character, the scene, location, game, or<br />
anywhere else that’s currently in play. We’ll start with character aspects,<br />
and then talk about <a href="../../fate-core/invoking-
compelling-aspects" title="Compelling Situation Aspects">situation aspects</a> in a bit.</p>
<p>In order to compel an aspect, explain why the aspect is relevant, and then<br />
make an offer as to what the complication is. You can negotiate the terms of<br />
the complication a bit, until you reach a reasonable consensus. Whoever is<br />
getting compelled then has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept the complication and receive a fate point</li>
<li>Pay a fate point to prevent the complication from happening</li>
</ul>
<p>The complication from a compel occurs regardless of anyone’s efforts—once<br />
you’ve made a deal and taken the fate point, you can’t use your skills or<br />
anything else to mitigate the situation. You have to deal with the new story<br />
developments that arise from the complication.</p>
<p>If you prevent the complication from happening, then you and the group<br />
describe how you avoid it. Sometimes it just means that you agree that the<br />
event never happened in the first place, and sometimes it means narrating your<br />
character doing something proactive. Whatever you need to do in order to make<br />
it make sense works fine, as long as the group is okay with it.</p>
<p>GMs, you’re the final arbiter here, as always—not just on how the result of a<br />
compel plays out, but on whether or not a compel is valid in the first place.<br />
Use the same judgment you apply to an invocation—it should make instinctive<br />
sense, or require only a small amount of explanation, that a complication<br />
might arise from the aspect.</p>
<p>Finally, and this is very important: <strong>if a player wants to compel another<br />
character, it costs a fate point to propose the complication.</strong> The GM can<br />
always compel for free, and any player can propose a compel on his or her own<br />
character for free.</p>
<h3 id="for-veterans_1">For Veterans<a class="headerlink" href="#for-veterans_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In other Fate games, you might have seen player-driven compels referred to as<br />
“invoking for effect.” It is clearer to just call it a compel, no matter who<br />
initiates it.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-compels">Types of Compels<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-compels" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are two major categories for what a compel looks like in the game:<br />
events and decisions. These are tools to help you figure out what a compel<br />
should look like and help break any mental blocks.</p>
<h4 id="events">Events<a class="headerlink" href="#events" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>An event-based compel happens to the character in spite of herself, when the<br />
world around her responds to a certain aspect in a certain way and creates a<br />
complicating circumstance. It looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have <strong><em>_ aspect and are in </em></strong>_ situation, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, ____ would happen to you. Damn your luck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere has <span class="aspect">Infamous Girl with Sword</span> while covertly<br />
attending a gladiatorial contest, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, an<br />
admirer would recognize her in the stands and make a huge fuss, turning all<br />
eyes in the arena her way. Damn her luck.</p>
<p>Landon has <span class="aspect">I Owe Old Finn Everything</span> and is returning to<br />
his home village after hearing it was sacked by barbarians, so it makes sense<br />
that, unfortunately, Old Finn was captured and taken far into the mountains<br />
with their war party. Damn his luck.</p>
<p>Zird has <span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia Arcana</span> and is attempting<br />
to get an audience with their Inner Council, so it makes sense that,<br />
unfortunately, his rivals force the Collegia to demand he provide a detailed<br />
account of his highly-coveted research to re-establish his relationship with<br />
the organization. Damn his luck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you’ll see with decision-based compels, the real mileage is in the<br />
complication itself. Without that, you don’t really have anything worth<br />
focusing on—the fact that the PCs continually have complicated and dramatic<br />
things happen to them is, well, exactly what makes them PCs in the first<br />
place.</p>
<p>GMs, event-based compels are your opportunity to party. You’re expected to<br />
control the world around the PCs, so having that world react to them in an<br />
unexpected way is pretty much part and parcel of your job description.</p>
<p>Players, event-based compels are great for you. You get rewarded simply by<br />
being there—how much more awesome can you get? You might have a difficult time<br />
justifying an event-based compel yourself, as it requires you to assert<br />
control over an element of the game that you typically aren’t in charge of.<br />
Feel free to propose an event-based compel, but remember that the GM has the<br />
final say on controlling the game world and may veto you if she’s got<br />
something else in mind.</p>
<h4 id="decisions">Decisions<a class="headerlink" href="#decisions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A decision is a kind of compel that is internal to the character. It happens<br />
because of a decision he makes, hence the name. It looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have <strong><em>_ aspect in </em></strong><em> situation, so it makes sense that you’d decide to <strong><em>_. This goes wrong when </em></strong></em> happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landon has <span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat</span> while trying to impress<br />
a dignitary at a royal ball, so it makes sense that he’d decide to share some<br />
boorish, raunchy humor and/or commentary. This goes wrong when he discovers<br />
she’s the princess of this country, and his offense is tantamount to a crime.</p>
<p>Cynere has <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny Things</span> while touring an<br />
ancient museum, so it makes sense that she’d decide to, ahem, liberate a<br />
couple of baubles for her personal collection. This goes wrong when she<br />
discovers that the artifacts are cursed, and she’s now beholden to the Keepers<br />
of the Museum if she wants the curse lifted.</p>
<p>Zird has <span class="aspect">Not the Face!</span> when he gets challenged to a<br />
barfight, so it makes sense that he’d decide to back down from the challenge.<br />
This goes wrong when the rest of the patrons decide he’s a coward and throw<br />
him unceremoniously out into the street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the real dramatic impact from these kinds of compels is not what decision<br />
the character makes, most of the time—it’s how things go wrong. Before<br />
something goes wrong, the first sentence could be a prelude to making a skill<br />
roll or simply a matter of roleplaying. The complication that the decision<br />
creates is really what makes it a compel.</p>
<p>GMs, remember that a player is ultimately responsible for everything that the<br />
character says and does. you can offer decision-based compels, but if the<br />
player doesn’t feel like the decision is one that the character would make,<br />
don’t force the issue by charging a fate point. instead, negotiate the terms<br />
of the compel until you find a decision the player is comfortable making, and<br />
a complication that chains from that decision instead. if you can’t agree on<br />
something, drop it.</p>
<p>The decision part should be very self-evident, and something a player might<br />
have been thinking about doing anyway. The same goes for players trying to<br />
compel NPCs or each other’s PCs—make sure you have a strong mutual<br />
understanding of what that NPC or other character might do before proposing<br />
the compel.</p>
<p>Players, if you need fate points, this is a really good way of getting them.<br />
If you propose a decision-based compel for your character to the GM, then what<br />
you’re basically asking is for something you’re about to do to go wrong<br />
somehow. You don’t even have to have a complication in mind—simply signaling<br />
the GM should be enough to start a conversation. GMs, as long as the compel<br />
isn’t weak (as in, as long as there’s a good, juicy complication), you should<br />
go with this. If the compel is weak, poll the rest of the group for ideas<br />
until something more substantial sticks.</p>
<p>If you offer a decision-based compel, and no one can agree on what the<br />
decision part should be, it shouldn’t cost a fate point to counter—just drop<br />
it. Countering a decision-based compel should only mean that the “what goes<br />
wrong” part doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>GMs, remember that a player is ultimately responsible for everything that the<br />
character says and does. You can offer decision-based compels, but if the<br />
player doesn’t feel like the decision is one that the character would make,<br />
don’t force the issue by charging a fate point. Instead, negotiate the terms<br />
of the compel until you find a decision the player is comfortable making, and<br />
a complication that chains from that decision instead. If you can’t agree on<br />
something, drop it.</p>
<h3 id="retroactive-compels">Retroactive Compels<a class="headerlink" href="#retroactive-compels" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll notice during the game that you’ve fulfilled the criteria<br />
for a compel without a fate point getting awarded. You’ve played your aspects<br />
to the hilt and gotten yourself into all kinds of trouble, or you’ve narrated<br />
crazy and dramatic stuff happening to a character related to their aspects<br />
just out of reflex.</p>
<p>Anyone who realizes this in play can mention it, and the fate point can be<br />
awarded retroactively, treating it like a compel after the fact. GMs, you’re<br />
the final arbiter. It should be pretty obvious when something like this<br />
occurs, though—just look at the guidelines for event and decision compels<br />
above, and see if you can summarize what happened in the game according to<br />
those guidelines. If you can, award a fate point.</p>
<h3 id="compelling-with-situation-aspects">Compelling with Situation Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#compelling-with-situation-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Just like with every other kind of aspect use, you can use situation aspects<br />
(and by extension, game aspects) for compels. Because situation aspects are<br />
usually external to characters, you’re almost always looking at event-based<br />
compels rather than decision-based ones. The character or characters affected<br />
get a fate point for the compel.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the warehouse is <span class="aspect">On Fire</span>, and the player<br />
characters are trapped in the middle of it, it makes sense that,<br />
unfortunately, the ruffian they’re chasing can get away in the confusion. Damn<br />
their luck.</p>
<p>The manor house Cynere is searching through is <span class="aspect">Littered with<br />
Debris</span>, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, the city guard is going<br />
to arrive there before she finds what she’s looking for, which will leave her<br />
with a lot of explaining to do. Damn her luck.</p>
<p>The ancient library Zird is currently working in has <span class="aspect">Layers of<br />
Dust</span> everywhere, so it makes sense that, unfortunately, while he might<br />
be able to find the information he’s looking for, the bounty hunter pursuing<br />
him will know that he was here. Damn his luck.</p>
