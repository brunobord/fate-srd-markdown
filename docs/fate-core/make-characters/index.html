<p>You <a href="../../fate-core/character-creation">can make player characters</a><br />
after finishing game creation, or you can do it in the middle of this<br />
process—follow your instincts here. If you find yourself talking more about<br />
the characters than the world, go to character creation and then float back<br />
around to whatever parts of game creation you haven’t done yet. Otherwise, go<br />
ahead and finish out all of game creation first.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the protagonists should have some connections to the<br />
faces and places you named in the previous step. If it’s difficult to relate<br />
the characters to the setting, then you may want to rethink your protagonists<br />
or revise your game so it will make a better fit for the new characters.</p>
<p>When you’re making characters, you’ll also discover a bit more about the<br />
setting as people talk about who their characters know and what their<br />
characters do. If anything comes up that should be added to your game creation<br />
notes, do so before pushing forward with playing the game.</p>

<p>A big part of your setting is what people can do in it. The various skills in<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/skills-stunts">Skills and Stunts</a> cover many<br />
situations, but you’ll want to look over them to see if any don’t apply or if<br />
there’s a skill you need to add.</p>
<p>Adding a skill is covered in more detail in the <a href="../../fate-
core/extras">Extras</a> section.</p>
