<h1 id="investigate">Investigate<a class="headerlink" href="#investigate" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Investigate is the skill you use to find things out. It’s a counterpart to<br />
Notice—whereas <a href="../../fate-core/notice">Notice</a> revolves around<br />
situational alertness and surface observation, Investigate revolves around<br />
concentrated effort and in-depth scrutiny.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: Investigate obstacles are all about<br />
information that’s hard to uncover for some reason. Analyzing a crime scene<br />
for clues, searching a cluttered room for the item you need, even poring over<br />
a musty old tome to try and find the passage that makes everything make sense.</p>
<p>Racing against the clock to collect evidence before the cops show up or<br />
disaster occurs is a classic way to use Investigate in a <a href="../../fate-core/challenges">challenge</a>.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: Investigate is probably<br />
one of the most versatile skills you can use to create an advantage. As long<br />
as you’re willing to take the time, you can find out just about anything about<br />
anyone, discover nearly any detail about a place or object, or otherwise make<br />
up aspects about nearly anything in the game world that your character could<br />
reasonably unearth.</p>
<p>If that sounds broad, consider the following as just a few of the<br />
possibilities for using Investigate: eavesdropping on a conversation, looking<br />
for clues at a crime scene, examining records, verifying the truth of a piece<br />
of information, conducting surveillance, and researching a cover story.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Investigate isn’t used to make attacks.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Same here.</p>
<h2 id="investigate-stunts">Investigate Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#investigate-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attention to Detail</strong>. You can use Investigate instead of Empathy to defend against Deceive attempts. What others discover through gut reactions and intuition, you learn through careful observation of microexpressions.</li>
<li><strong>Eavesdropper</strong>. On a successful Investigate roll to create an advantage by eavesdropping on a conversation, you can discover or create one additional aspect (though this doesn’t give you an extra free invocation).</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Power of Deduction</strong>. Once per scene you can spend a fate point (and a few minutes of observation) to make a special Investigate roll representing your potent deductive faculties. For each shift you make on this roll you discover or create an aspect, on either the scene or the target of your observations, though you may only invoke one of them for free.</p>
