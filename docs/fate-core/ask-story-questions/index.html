<p>Now that you have a really grabby problem, you can flesh the situation out a<br />
little and figure out precisely what your scenario is intended to resolve—in<br />
other words, what are the really grabby questions at the heart of this<br />
problem?</p>
<p>That’s what you’ll do in this step: create a series of questions that you want<br />
your scenario to answer.<strong> We call these story questions</strong>, because the story<br />
will emerge naturally from the process of answering them.</p>
<p>The more story questions you have, the longer your scenario’s going to be. One<br />
to three story questions will probably wrap up in a session. Four to eight<br />
might take you two or even three sessions. More than eight or nine, and you<br />
might have to save some of those questions for the next scenario, but that’s<br />
not a bad thing at all.</p>
<p>It is recommended asking story questions as yes/no questions, in the general<br />
format of, “Can/Will (character) accomplish (goal)?” You don’t have to follow<br />
that phrasing exactly, and you can embellish on the basic question format in a<br />
number of ways, which will be demonstrated in a moment.</p>
<p>Every problem you come up with is going to have one very obvious story<br />
question: “Can the PC(s) resolve the problem?” You do need to know that<br />
eventually, but you don’t want to skip straight to that—it’s your finale for<br />
the scenario, after all. Put other questions before that one to add nuance and<br />
complexity to the scenario and build up to that final question. Figure out<br />
what makes the problem difficult to solve.</p>
<p>To come up with story questions, you’re probably going to have to embellish on<br />
the problem that you came up with just a bit, and figure out some of the W-How<br />
(who, what, when, where, why, how) details. That’s also fine, and part of what<br />
the process is for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Arcane Conspiracy: Problem and Story Questions</p>
<p>Cynere is <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny Things</span>, and Zird has<br />
<span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia </span><span class="aspect">Arcan</span>a, which<br />
implies that the Collegia’s wealth might end up on Cynere’s radar at an<br />
inconvenient time for Zird. Therefore, Cynere getting a lucrative contract to<br />
steal one of the Collegia’s sacred treasures at the same time that Zird’s<br />
rivals try to put him on trial for crimes against creation would probably be a<br />
big problem for both of them.</p>
<p>Two obvious story questions spring to mind already: Will Cynere get the<br />
treasure? Will Zird win his trial? But Amanda wants to save those answers for<br />
the end, so she brainstorms some other questions.</p>
<p>First of all, she doesn’t know if they’re even going to go willingly into<br />
this situation, so she starts there: Will Cynere take the contract? Will Zird<br />
allow the Collegia to arrest him, or will he resist?</p>
<p>Then, she needs to figure out why they can’t just go straight to the<br />
problem. She decides Cynere has an anonymous rival for the treasure (let’s<br />
call it the Jewel of Aetheria, that sounds nice), and her mysterious employer<br />
would be most displeased if the rival beat her to the punch.</p>
<p>Zird, in the meantime, has to secure a legal defense that isn’t a part of<br />
the conspiracy against him, and will probably want to find out precisely who<br />
has it in for him this time.</p>
<p>So, that gives her three more questions: Can Cynere sniff out her competitor<br />
before her competitor does the same to her? Can Zird find an ally to defend<br />
him among the Collegia’s ranks? Can Zird discover the architects of the<br />
conspiracy without suffering further consequences?</p>
<p>Then, because she wants some tension between these two, one that relates to<br />
their relationship: Will Cynere turn her back on Zird for the sake of her own<br />
goals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that each of these questions has the potential to significantly shape<br />
the scenario’s plot. Right off the bat, if Zird decides not to go quietly, you<br />
have a very different situation than if he chooses to submit to custody. If<br />
Zird’s investigations get him arrested, then the trial might end up being a<br />
moot point. If Cynere decides to help Zird rather than pursuing the Jewel,<br />
then they’re going to have another source of trouble in the form of Cynere’s<br />
employer.</p>
<p>Also notice that a few of the story questions have something else that<br />
modifies the basic “Can X accomplish Y?” format. The reason why you want to do<br />
this is the same reason you want to avoid rolling dice sometimes—black and<br />
white success/failure isn’t always interesting, especially on the failure<br />
side.</p>
<p>Look at one of the questions for Cynere: “Will Cynere discover the identity of<br />
her chief competitor for the Jewel before the competitor discovers hers?”<br />
Without the emphasized part, it’d be kind of boring—if she fails to discover<br />
her opponent’s identity, then we’ve pretty much dropped that plot thread, and<br />
part of the game stalls out. No good.</p>
<p>The way it is phrased it, though, you have somewhere to go if she doesn’t do<br />
well in this part of the scenario—she may not know who her rival is, but her<br />
rival knows her now. Whatever happens with the Jewel, that rival can come back<br />
to haunt her in a future scenario. Or, we take it as a given that we’re going<br />
to reveal the rival’s identity to Cynere eventually, but we can still have a<br />
tense set of conflicts or contests leading up to that reveal as they suss out<br />
each other’s abilities.</p>
<p>There’s also some room to extend material from this scenario into the future.<br />
Maybe the identity of Cynere’s opponent doesn’t get answered this session at<br />
all—that’s okay, because it’s a detail Amanda can always bring back in a later<br />
session.</p>
<p>If you end up with a really large number of story questions (like eight or<br />
more), keep in mind that you don’t necessarily have to answer them all in one<br />
scenario—you can bring up the questions you don’t answer, either as<br />
foreshadowing or to set up stuff you’re going to do in the following scenario.<br />
In fact, that’s exactly how you make <a href="../../fate-core
/building-arc" title="Building An Arc">strong arcs</a>—you have a pile of related story questions,<br />
and you take two or three scenarios to answer them all.</p>
