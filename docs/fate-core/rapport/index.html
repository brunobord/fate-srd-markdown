<p>The Rapport skill is all about making positive connections to people and<br />
eliciting positive emotion. It’s the skill of being liked and trusted.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: Use Rapport to charm or inspire people<br />
to do what you want, or to establish a good connection with them. Charm your<br />
way past the guard, convince someone to take you into their confidence, or<br />
become the man of the hour at the local tavern. For nameless NPCs, this is<br />
just an overcome action, but you may have to enter a contest to sufficiently<br />
ingratiate yourself to a named NPC or PC.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: Use Rapport to establish<br />
a positive mood on a target or in a scene or to get someone to confide in you<br />
out of a genuine sense of trust. You could pep talk someone into having<br />
Elevated Confidence, or stir a crowd into a <span class="aspect">Joyful Fervor</span>,<br />
or simply make someone <span class="aspect">Talkative</span> or<br />
<span class="aspect">Helpful</span>.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Rapport doesn’t cause harm, so you don’t<br />
use it for attacks.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Rapport defends against any skill used to<br />
damage your reputation, sour a mood you’ve created, or make you look bad in<br />
front of other people. It does not, however, defend against mental attacks.<br />
That requires <a href="../../fate-core/will">Will</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Best Foot Forward</strong>. Twice per session, you may upgrade a boost you receive with Rapport into a full situation aspect with a free invocation.</li>
<li><strong>Demagogue</strong>. +2 to Rapport when you’re delivering an inspiring speech in front of a crowd. (If there are named NPCs or PCs in the scene, you may target them all simultaneously with one roll rather than dividing up your shifts.)</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Popular</strong>. If you’re in an area where you’re popular and well-liked, you can use Rapport in place of Contacts. You may be able to establish your popularity by spending a fate point to declare a story detail, or because of prior justification.</p>
