<p><strong>When you roll the dice, either you’re going to fail, tie, succeed, or succeed with style.</strong></p>
<p>Every roll you make in a Fate game results in one of four outcomes, generally<br />
speaking. The specifics may change a little depending on what kind of <a href="../../fate-core/four-actions">action<br />
you’re taking</a>, but all the game<br />
actions fit this general pattern.</p>
<h2 id="fail">Fail<a class="headerlink" href="#fail" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>If you roll lower than your opposition, you fail.</strong></p>
<p>This means one of several things: you don’t get what you want, you get what<br />
you want at a <a href="../../fate-core/what-do-during-play">serious cost</a>, or<br />
you suffer some negative mechanical consequence. Sometimes, it means more than<br />
one of those. It’s the GM’s job to determine an appropriate cost.</p>
<h2 id="tie">Tie<a class="headerlink" href="#tie" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>If you roll the same as your opposition, you tie.</strong></p>
<p>This means you get what you want, but at a minor cost, or you get a lesser<br />
version of what you wanted.</p>
<h2 id="succeed">Succeed<a class="headerlink" href="#succeed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>If you roll higher than your opposition by 1 or 2 shifts, you succeed.</strong></p>
<p>This means you get what you want at no cost.</p>
<h2 id="succeed-with-style">Succeed with Style<a class="headerlink" href="#succeed-with-style" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>If you roll higher than your opposition by 3 or more shifts, you succeed with style.</strong></p>
<p>This means that you get what you want, but you also get an added benefit on<br />
top of that.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-gm-serious-cost-vs-minor-cost">For the GM: Serious Cost Vs. Minor Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#for-the-gm-serious-cost-vs-minor-cost" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>When you’re thinking about costs, think both about the story in play and the<br />
game mechanics to help you figure out what would be most appropriate.</p>
<p>A serious cost should make the current situation worse somehow, either by<br />
creating a new problem or exacerbating an existing one. Bring in another<br />
source of opposition in this scene or the next one (such as a new opposing NPC<br />
or an obstacle to overcome), or ask the player to take a consequence at their<br />
lowest free level, or give someone who opposes the PC an advantage with a free<br />
invocation.</p>
<p>A minor cost should add a story detail that’s problematic or bad for the PC,<br />
but doesn’t necessarily endanger progress. You could also ask the PC to take<br />
stress or give someone who opposes the PCs a boost.</p>
<p>It’s okay if the minor cost is mainly a narrative detail, showing how the PC<br />
just barely scratched by. See more advice about dealing with costs on in<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/running-game">Running the Game</a>.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-gm-how-hard-should-skill-rolls-be">For the GM: How Hard Should Skill Rolls Be?<a class="headerlink" href="#for-the-gm-how-hard-should-skill-rolls-be" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>For active opposition, you don’t really need to worry about how hard the roll<br />
is—just use the NPC’s skill level and roll the dice like the players do,<br />
letting the chips fall where they may. There are guidelines about NPC skill<br />
levels in <a href="../../fate-core/running-game">Running the Game</a>.</p>
<p>For passive opposition, you have to decide what rank on the ladder the player<br />
has to beat. It’s more an art than a science, but there are some guidelines to<br />
help you.</p>
<p>Anything that’s two or more steps higher than the PC’s skill level—Fair (+2)<br />
skill and Great (+4) opposition, for example— means that the player will<br />
probably fail or need to invoke aspects to succeed.</p>
<p>Anything that’s two or more steps lower than the PC’s skill level—Fair (+2)<br />
skill and Mediocre (+0) opposition, for example—means that the player will<br />
probably not need to invoke aspects and have a good chance of succeeding with<br />
style.</p>
<p>Between that range, there’s a roughly equal chance that they’ll tie or<br />
succeed, and a roughly equal chance that they will or won’t need to invoke<br />
aspects to do so.</p>
<p>Therefore, low difficulties are best when you want to give the PCs a chance to<br />
show off and be awesome, difficulties near their skill levels are best when<br />
you want to provide tension but not overwhelm them, and high difficulties are<br />
best when you want to emphasize how dire or unusual the circumstances are and<br />
make them pull out all the stops.</p>
<p>Finally, a couple of quick axioms:</p>
<p>Average is called Average for a reason—if nothing about the opposition sticks<br />
out, then the difficulty doesn’t need more than a +1.</p>
<p>If you can think of at least one reason why the opposition sticks out, but<br />
otherwise just can’t decide what the difficulty should be, pick Fair (+2).<br />
It’s in the middle of a PC’s range of skills, so it provides a decent<br />
challenge for every skill level except Great (+4), and you want to give PCs a<br />
chance to show off their peak skill anyway.</p>
