<p>An extra in Fate is a pretty broad term. It is used to describe anything<br />
that’s technically part of a character or controlled by a character, but gets<br />
special treatment in the rules. If your Fate game were a movie, this is where<br />
the special effects budget would go.</p>
<p>Some examples of extras include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic and supernatural powers</li>
<li>Specialized gear or equipment, like enchanted arms and armor in a fantasy game or hyper-tech in a sci-fi game</li>
<li>Vehicles owned by the characters</li>
<li>Organizations or locations that the characters rule or have a lot of influence over</li>
</ul>
<p>The tools in here will let you tailor extras to fit your game or provide<br />
material to steal right off the page. It’s okay, steal away.</p>
<p>Extras are considered to be an extension of the character sheet, so whoever<br />
controls the character to whom the extra belongs also controls that extra.<br />
Most of the time, that’ll be the players, but NPCs may also have extras<br />
controlled by the GM.</p>
<p>Extras require a <a href="../../fate-core/creating-extra" title="Creating An Extra">permission or cost</a> to own.</p>

<p>Before going any further, here’s something important:</p>
<p><strong>In Fate, you can treat anything in the game world like it’s a character. Anything can have aspects, skills, stunts, stress tracks, and consequences if you need it to.</strong></p>
<p>This is called this the <a href="../../fate-system-toolkit
/bronze-rule">Bronze Rule</a>, but you may also have heard of it as the Fate Fractal if you<br />
pay attention to the Internet. You’ve already seen some examples of this in<br />
other places on the site; you give your game its own aspects during creation,<br />
you place situation aspects on the environment as well as on characters, and<br />
the GM can let <a href="../../fate-core/what-do-
during-play" title="What To Do During Play">environmental hazards</a> attack as if they had skills.</p>
<p>Extras extend the Bronze rule even further.</p>
