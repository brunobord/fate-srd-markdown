<p>The setting might be small or it might be vast, but where your stories take<br />
place determines the scale of your game.</p>
<p>In a small-scale game, characters deal with problems in a city or region, they<br />
don’t travel a great deal, and the problems are local. A large-scale game<br />
involves dealing with problems that affect a world, a civilization, or even a<br />
galaxy if the genre you’re playing in can handle that kind of thing.<br />
(Sometimes, a small-scale game will turn into a large-scale one over time, as<br />
you’ve probably seen in long-running novel series or television shows.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda likes the vibe of “guy and girl with sword,” and thinks it’ll shine<br />
as a small-scale game, where they might travel from town to town, but the<br />
problems they have to deal with are local—like a thieves’ guild or the<br />
regent’s vile machinations.</p>
