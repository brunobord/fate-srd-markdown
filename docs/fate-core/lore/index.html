<p>The Lore skill is about knowledge and education. As with some other skills, we<br />
called it Lore because that fits the particular flavor of our examples—other<br />
games might call it Scholarship, or Academics, or something like that.</p>
<p>If your game has a reason to prioritize different fields of knowledge as being<br />
separate from one another, you might have several skills that follow the same<br />
basic template. For example, you might have a Lore skill that’s reserved for<br />
supernatural and arcane knowledge, and a Scholar skill for more traditional<br />
education.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: You can use Lore to overcome any<br />
obstacle that requires applying your character’s knowledge to achieve a goal.<br />
For example, you might roll Lore to decipher some ancient language on a tomb<br />
wall, under the presumption that your character might have researched it at<br />
some point.</p>
<p>Frankly, you can use Lore as a go-to skill any time you need to know if your<br />
character can answer a difficult question, where some tension exists in not<br />
knowing the answer.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: Like Investigate, Lore<br />
provides a lot of very flexible opportunities to create advantages, provided<br />
you can research the subject in question. More often than not, you’ll be using<br />
Lore to get a story detail, some obscure bit of information that you uncover<br />
or know already, but if that information gives you an edge in a future scene,<br />
it might take the form of an aspect. Likewise, you can use Lore to create<br />
advantages based on any subject matter your character might have studied,<br />
which gives you a fun way to add details to the setting.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Lore isn’t used in conflicts.</p>
<p>(In our examples, the magic that Zird the Arcane uses is based on Lore, so<br />
that’s a unique exception to this—he could conceivably use Lore for magical<br />
attacks and defenses. See the <a href="../../fate-core/extras">Extras</a><br />
section for more details about ways to do magic and powers.)</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Lore isn’t used to defend.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I’ve Read about That!</strong> You’ve read hundreds—if not thousands—of books on a wide variety of topics. You can spend a fate point to use Lore in place of any other skill for one roll or exchange, provided you can justify having read about the action you’re attempting.</li>
<li><strong>Shield of Reason</strong>. You can use Lore as a defense against Provoke attempts, provided you can justify your ability to overcome your fear through rational thought and reason.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Specialist</strong>. Choose a field of specialization, such as herbology, criminology, or zoology. You get a +2 to all Lore rolls relating to that field of specialization.</p>
