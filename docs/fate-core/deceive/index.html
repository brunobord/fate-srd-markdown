<p>Deceive is the skill about lying to and misdirecting people.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: Use Deceive to bluff your way past<br />
someone, or to get someone to believe a lie, or to get something out of<br />
someone because they believe in one of your lies. For nameless NPCs, this is<br />
just an overcome roll, but for PCs or named NPCs, it requires a contest, and<br />
the target opposes with Empathy. Winning this contest could justify placing a<br />
situation aspect on your target, if buying into your lie could help you in a<br />
future scene.</p>
<p>Deceive is the skill you use for determining if a disguise works, whether on<br />
yourself or others. You’ll need to have the time and supplies to create the<br />
desired effect. (Note: This is mainly a Hearts of Steelthing; in some games,<br />
this may not be appropriate for Deceive by default and should require a<br />
stunt.)</p>
<p>You can also use Deceive to do small tricks of sleight-of-hand and<br />
misdirection.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: Use Deceive to create<br />
momentary distractions, cover stories, or false impressions. You could feint<br />
in a swordfight, putting an opponent <span class="aspect">Off-Balance</span> and<br />
setting you up for an attack. You could do the whole, “What’s that over<br />
there!” trick to give you a <span class="aspect">Head Start</span> when you run away.<br />
You could establish a <span class="aspect">Wealthy Noble Cover Story</span> for when<br />
you attend a royal ball. You could trick someone into revealing one of their<br />
aspects or other information.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Deceive is an indirect skill that creates<br />
a lot of opportunities you can capitalize on, but it doesn’t do direct harm to<br />
an individual.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: You can use Deceive to throw off<br />
Investigation attempts with false information and to defend against efforts<br />
made to discern your true motives with the Empathy skill.</p>
<h2 id="deceive-stunts">Deceive Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#deceive-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lies upon Lies</strong>. +2 to create a Deceive advantage against someone who has believed one of your lies already during this session.</li>
<li><strong>Mind Games</strong>. You can use Deceive in place of Provoke to make mental attacks, as long as you can make up a clever lie as part of the attack.</li>
<li><strong>One Person, Many Faces</strong>. Whenever you meet someone new, you can spend a fate point to declare that you’ve met that person before, but under a different name and identity. Create a situation aspect to represent your cover story, and you can use Deceive in place of Rapport whenever interacting with that person.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="social-skills-and-other-characters">Social Skills and Other Characters<a class="headerlink" href="#social-skills-and-other-characters" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Many of the social skills have actions that let you change the emotional state<br />
of another character or make them accept some fact in the story (like<br />
believing one of your lies).</p>
<p>A successful use of a social skill does not confer the authority to force<br />
another character to act contrary to their nature or how the person<br />
controlling the character sees them. If another PC gets affected by one of<br />
your skills, the player gets input on how their character responds. They can’t<br />
negate your victory, but they can choose what it looks like.</p>
<p>So, you may successfully Provoke by getting in their face and screaming at<br />
them, intending to scare them into hesitation and create an advantage. But if<br />
the other player doesn’t imagine his character reacting that way, you should<br />
work out an alternative—maybe you make him so angry that he’s unbalanced by<br />
his rage, or you embarrass him by making a spectacle around him in public.</p>
<p>As long as you get your advantage, you’re fine. Use it as an opportunity to<br />
create story with other people, instead of shutting them down.</p>
