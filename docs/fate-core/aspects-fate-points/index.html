<p>An aspect is a phrase that describes something unique or noteworthy about<br />
whatever it’s attached to. They’re the primary way you spend and gain fate<br />
points, and they influence the story by providing an opportunity for a<br />
character to get a bonus, complicating a character’s life, or adding to<br />
another character’s roll or passive opposition.</p>
<h2 id="defining-fate-points">Defining Fate Points<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-fate-points" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>GMs and players, you both have a pool of points called <a href="../../fate-core/fate-points" title="Fate Points">fate points</a> you can use to influence the<br />
game. You represent these with tokens, as we mentioned in The Basics. Players,<br />
you start with a certain number of points every scenario, equal to your<br />
character’s refresh. You’ll also reset to your refresh rate if you ended a<br />
mid-scenario session with fewer fate points than your rate. GMs, <a href="../../fate-core/fate-point-economy" title="Fate Point
Economy">you get a<br />
budget of fate points</a> to spend in every scene.</p>
<p>When your aspects come into play, you will usually spend or gain a fate point.</p>
