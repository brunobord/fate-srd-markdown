<h1 id="types-of-aspects">Types of Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Every game of Fate has a few different kinds of aspects: game aspects,<br />
character aspects, situation aspects, consequences, and boosts. They mainly<br />
differ from one another in terms of what they’re attached to and how long they<br />
last.</p>
<h2 id="game-aspects">Game Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#game-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Game aspects are permanent fixtures of the game, hence the name. While they<br />
might change over time, they’re never going to go away. If you’ve already gone<br />
through game creation, you’ve already defined these—<a href="../../fate-core/setting%E2%80%99s-big-issues">the current or impending<br />
issues</a> that you came<br />
up with. They describe problems or threats that exist in the world, which are<br />
going to be the basis for your game’s story.</p>
<p>Everyone can invoke, compel, or create an advantage on a game aspect at any<br />
time; they’re always there and available for anyone’s use.</p>
<h2 id="character-aspects">Character Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#character-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Character aspects are just as permanent, but smaller in scope, attached to an<br />
individual PC or NPC. They describe a near-infinite number of things that set<br />
the character apart, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant personality traits or beliefs (<span class="aspect">Sucker for a Pretty Face</span>, <span class="aspect">Never Leave a Man Behind</span>, <span class="aspect">The Only Good Tsyntavian Is a Dead Tsyntavian</span>).</li>
<li>The character’s background or profession (<span class="aspect">Educated at the Academy of Blades</span>, <span class="aspect">Born a Spacer</span>, <span class="aspect">Cybernetic Street Thief</span>).</li>
<li>An important possession or noticeable feature (<span class="aspect">My Father’s Bloodstained Sword</span>, <span class="aspect">Dressed to the Nines</span>, <span class="aspect">Sharp Eyed Veteran</span>).</li>
<li>Relationships to people and organizations (<span class="aspect">In League with the Twisting Hand</span>, <span class="aspect">The King’s Favor</span>, <span class="aspect">Proud Member of the Company of Lords</span>).</li>
<li>Problems, goals, or issues the character is dealing with (<span class="aspect">A Price on My Head</span>, <span class="aspect">The King Must Die</span>, <span class="aspect">Fear of Heights</span>).</li>
<li>Titles, reputations, or obligations the character may have (<span class="aspect">Self-Important Merchant Guildmaster</span>, <span class="aspect">Silver-Tongued Scoundrel</span>, <span class="aspect">Honor-Bound to Avenge My Brother</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can invoke or call for a compel on any of your character aspects whenever<br />
they’re relevant. GMs, you can always propose compels to any PC. Players, you<br />
can suggest compels for other people’s characters, but the GM is always going<br />
to get the final say on whether or not it’s a valid suggestion.</p>
<h2 id="situation-aspects">Situation Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#situation-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A situation aspect is temporary, intended to last only for a single scene or<br />
until it no longer makes sense (but no longer than a session, at most).<br />
Situation aspects can be attached to the environment the scene takes place<br />
in—which affects everybody in the scene—but you can also attach them to<br />
specific characters by targeting them when you <a href="../../fate-core/four-actions" title="Create An Advantage">create an advantage</a>.</p>
<p>Situation aspects describe significant features of the circumstances the<br />
characters are dealing with in a scene. That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical features of the environment (<span class="aspect">Dense Underbrush</span>, <span class="aspect">Obscuring Snowdrifts</span>, <span class="aspect">Low Gravity Planet</span>).</li>
<li>Positioning or placement (<span class="aspect">Sniper’s Perch</span>, <span class="aspect">In the Trees</span>, <span class="aspect">Backyard</span>).</li>
<li>Immediate obstacles (<span class="aspect">Burning Barn</span>, <span class="aspect">Tricky Lock</span>, <span class="aspect">Yawning Chasm</span>).</li>
<li>Contextual details that are likely to come into play (<span class="aspect">Disgruntled Townsfolk</span>, <span class="aspect">Security Cameras</span>, <span class="aspect">Loud Machinery</span>).</li>
<li>Sudden changes in a character’s status (<span class="aspect">Sand in the Eyes</span>, <span class="aspect">Disarmed</span>, <span class="aspect">Cornered</span>, <span class="aspect">Covered in Slime</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Who can use a situation aspect depends a lot on narrative context—sometimes<br />
it’ll be very clear, and sometimes you’ll need to justify how you’re using the<br />
aspect to make sense based on what’s happening in the scene. GMs, you’re the<br />
final arbiter on what claims on an aspect are valid.</p>
<p>Sometimes situation aspects become obstacles that characters need to <a href="../../fate-core/four-actions" title="Overcome">overcome<br />
</a>. Other times they give<br />
you justification to provide active opposition against someone else’s action.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences<a class="headerlink" href="#consequences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A consequence is more permanent than a situation aspect, but not quite as<br />
permanent as a character aspect. They’re a special kind of aspect you take in<br />
order to avoid getting taken out in a conflict, and they describe lasting<br />
injuries or problems that you take away from a <a href="../../fate-
core/conflicts" title="Conflict">conflict</a> (<span class="aspect">Dislocated Shoulder</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Bloody Nose</span>, <span class="aspect">Social Pariah</span>).</p>
<p>Consequences stick around for a variable length of time, from a few scenes to<br />
a scenario or two, depending on how severe they are. Because of their negative<br />
phrasing, you’re likely to get compelled a lot when you have them, and anyone<br />
who can justifiably benefit from the consequence can invoke it or create an<br />
advantage on it.</p>
<h2 id="boosts">Boosts<a class="headerlink" href="#boosts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Boosts are a super-transient kind of aspect. You get a boost when you’re<br />
trying to create an advantage but don’t succeed well enough, or as an added<br />
benefit to succeeding especially well at an action. You get to invoke them for<br />
free, but as soon as you do, the aspect goes away.</p>
<p>If you want, you can also allow another character to invoke your boost, if<br />
it’s relevant and could help them out.</p>
<h3 id="a-clarification-about-boosts-from-ryan-macklin-and-leonard-balsera">A Clarification About Boosts from Ryan Macklin and Leonard Balsera<a class="headerlink" href="#a-clarification-about-boosts-from-ryan-macklin-and-leonard-balsera" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The following was <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2014/01/fate-boosts-revisited/">posted on Ryan Macklin's Web<br />
site</a> for clearer<br />
language that shows the intent and utility of Boosts. The article also<br />
includes a bit of design history about boosts.</p>
<h4 id="boosts_1">Boosts<a class="headerlink" href="#boosts_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Boosts are temporary, free-floating invocations that happen when you get a<br />
momentary benefit that isn’t lasting enough to be an aspect. You get a boost<br />
when you’re trying to create an advantage but don’t succeed well enough, or as<br />
an added benefit to succeeding especially well at an action (notably<br />
defending). You invoke boosts just like you would for an aspect, for the +2,<br />
reroll, or other effect that a free invoke can do. As with aspect invocations,<br />
you need to describe what’s happening that makes that boost relevant to your<br />
action.</p>
<p>Once you invoke the boost, it goes away. They go away on their own fairly<br />
quickly—usually after the next action when you could use them—so use them as<br />
soon as possible! If you want, you can allow another character to invoke your<br />
boost, though it needs to be relevant to their action and could help them out.</p>
<p>When you earn a boost, give it a name like you would an aspect to help you<br />
remember where the boost came from and how you can use it. Don’t dwell on<br />
coming up with something clever, since it doesn’t last long.</p>
<p>Just remember that a boost isn’t a full, “grown up” aspect—you can’t compel<br />
with it, use it as permission for extras, pay a fate point to invoke it again,<br />
or other things that manipulate aspects or that aspects affect. But you can<br />
promote it to a full aspect; see Promoting Boosts below.​</p>
<h4 id="leaving-boosts-unnamed">Leaving Boosts Unnamed<a class="headerlink" href="#leaving-boosts-unnamed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If you’re struggling to name a boost, let it be unnamed and continue<br />
playing—boosts aren’t worth stopping play to name! If you do, though, you’ll<br />
have to keep track of the situation that created the boost, which some people<br />
find difficult to remember.</p>
<h4 id="promoting-boosts">Promoting Boosts<a class="headerlink" href="#promoting-boosts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes when you’re creating a new aspect, you find that there’s a boost in<br />
play that’s exactly the aspect you want to make, turning a momentary benefit<br />
into a lasting one. Great! That’s called promoting a boost. Just declare an<br />
aspect you’re making to have the same name as a boost in play, and you’re<br />
done. If the action gives this new aspect a free invocation, it has two<br />
instead thanks to the boost being active. If you haven’t named the boost yet,<br />
now’s the time to do it.</p>
<p>For example, say you parry my sword strike and get a boost from that defend<br />
action, and we say that you managed to get me <span class="aspect">A Little Off-<br />
Balance</span>. On your next action, you follow-up by saying that you want to<br />
keep me off-balance by creating an advantage. You roll for the advantage,<br />
succeed without needing to use the boost, and then name the advantage<br />
<span class="aspect">A Little Off-Balance</span> with two free invocations (or three<br />
if you succeeded with style—essentially one extra free invocation).</p>
<p>Even if you’ve used a boost already, nothing says you can’t bring that idea<br />
back around as an aspect later in the scene if it’s appropriate. There’s no<br />
special rule about that, just something to keep in mind. In our example above,<br />
you could still create the <span class="aspect">A Little Off-Balance</span> advantage,<br />
even if you use the boost on that roll or on a past turn.</p>
<h4 id="remember-that-boosts-are-not-aspects">Remember that Boosts are not Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#remember-that-boosts-are-not-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Unlike aspects, you cannot compel a boost or pay a fate point to invoke a<br />
boost (including <a href="../../fate-core
/fate-point-economy#earning-fate-points">invoking it against its owner</a>). Any other rules that require an<br />
aspect to exist or be used don’t count for boosts. Don’t let the fact that<br />
they’re often given names mislead you.</p>
