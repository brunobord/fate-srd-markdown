<h1 id="conflicts">Conflicts<a class="headerlink" href="#conflicts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In a conflict, characters are actively trying to harm one another. It could be<br />
a fist fight, a shootout, or a sword duel. It could also be a tough<br />
interrogation, a psychic assault, or a shouting match with a loved one.<strong> As<br />
long as the characters involved have both the intent and the ability to harm<br />
one another, then you’re in a conflict scene.</strong></p>
<p>Conflicts are either physical or mental in nature, based on the kind of harm<br />
you’re at risk of suffering. In physical conflicts, you suffer bruises,<br />
scrapes, cuts, and other injuries. In mental conflicts, you suffer loss of<br />
confidence and self-esteem, loss of composure, and other psychological trauma.</p>
<p>Setting up a conflict is a little more involved than setting up contests or<br />
challenges. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the scene, describing the environment the conflict takes place in, creating situation aspects and zones, and establishing who’s participating and what side they’re on.</li>
<li>Determine the turn order.</li>
<li>Start the first exchange:<ul>
<li>On your turn, take an action and then resolve it.</li>
<li>On other people’s turns, defend or respond to their actions as necessary.</li>
<li>At the end of everyone’s turn, start again with a new exchange.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You know the conflict is over when everyone on one of the sides has<br />
<strong>conceded</strong> or been <strong>taken out.</strong></p>
<h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-the-scene" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>GMs and players, you should talk briefly before you start a conflict about the<br />
circumstances of the scene. This mainly involves coming up with quick answers<br />
to variations of the four W-questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s in the conflict?</li>
<li>Where are they positioned relative to one another?</li>
<li>When is the conflict taking place? Is that important?</li>
<li>What’s the environment like?</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need an exhaustive amount of detail here, like precise measures of<br />
distance or anything like that. Just resolve enough to make it clear for<br />
everyone what’s going on.</p>
<p>GMs, you’re going to take this information and create situation aspects to<br />
help further define the arena of conflict.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Landon, Zird, and Cynere are breaking into a dockside warehouse in order to<br />
find smuggled goods on behalf of their latest employer. Unfortunately, someone<br />
tipped the smuggler off. Now Og, one of his thug lieutenants, is at the<br />
warehouse waiting for them to show up, and he brought along four friends.</p>
<p>The participants in the conflict are pretty obvious—the PCs, plus Og and<br />
four nameless enforcers, all NPCs under Amanda’s control. The warehouse is the<br />
environment, and the group takes a moment to talk about it—boxes and crates<br />
everywhere, large and open, there’s probably a second floor, and Amanda<br />
mentions the loading door is open because they’re waiting for a ship to come<br />
in.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="situation-aspects">Situation Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#situation-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>GMs, when you’re setting the scene, keep an eye out for fun-sounding features<br />
of the environment to make into <a href="http://www.faterpg.com/wp-
content/uploads/2013/06/Fate-Core-SRD-OGL.html#Anchor-136">situation aspects</a>, especially if you<br />
think someone might be able to take advantage of them in an interesting way in<br />
a conflict. Don’t overload it—find three to five evocative things about your<br />
conflict location and make them into aspects.</p>
<p>Good options for situation aspects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything regarding the general mood, weather, or lighting—dark or badly lit, storming, creepy, crumbling, blindingly bright, etc.</li>
<li>Anything that might affect or restrict movement—filthy, mud everywhere, slippery, rough, etc.</li>
<li>Things to hide behind—vehicles, obstructions, large furniture, etc.</li>
<li>Things you can knock over, wreck, or use as improvised weapons—bookshelves, statues, etc.</li>
<li>Things that are flammable</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="situation-aspects-zones-in-mental-conflicts">Situation Aspects &amp; Zones In Mental Conflicts<a class="headerlink" href="#situation-aspects-zones-in-mental-conflicts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In a mental conflict, it might not always make sense to use situation aspects<br />
and zones to describe a physical space. It’d make sense in an interrogation,<br />
for example, where the physical features of the space create fear, but not in<br />
a really violent argument with a loved one. Also, when people are trying to<br />
hurt each other emotionally, usually they’re using their target’s own<br />
weaknesses against them—in other words, their own aspects.</p>
<p>So, you may not even need situation aspects or zones for a lot of mental<br />
conflicts. Don’t feel obligated to include them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Considering our warehouse again, Amanda thinks about what might make good<br />
situation aspects.</p>
<p>She decides that there are enough crates in here to make free movement a<br />
potential problem, so she picks <span class="aspect">Heavy Crates</span> and<br />
<span class="aspect">Cramped</span> as aspects. The loading door is open, which means<br />
that there’s a large dock with water in it, so she also picks<br />
<span class="aspect">Open to the Water</span> as a situation aspect, figuring that<br />
someone might try to knock someone in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the scene unfolds, players might suggest features of the environment that<br />
are perfect as aspects. If the GM described the scene as being poorly lit, a<br />
player should be able to invoke the Shadows to help on a Stealth roll even if<br />
she hadn’t previously established it as an aspect. If the feature would<br />
require some intervention on the part of the characters in the scene to become<br />
aspect-worthy, then that’s the purview of the <a href="../../fate-core/four-actions" title="Create An Advantage">create an advantage action<br />
</a>. Usually the<br />
barn doesn’t catch <span class="aspect">On Fire!</span> without someone kicking over<br />
the lantern. Usually.</p>
<h3 id="zones">Zones<a class="headerlink" href="#zones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>GMs, if your conflict takes place over a large area, you may want to break it<br />
down into zones for easier reference.</p>
<p>A zone is an abstract representation of physical space. The best definition of<br />
a zone is that it’s close enough that you can interact directly with someone<br />
(in other words, walk up to and punch them in the face).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a conflict should rarely involve more than a handful of<br />
zones. Two to four is probably sufficient, save for really big conflicts. This<br />
isn’t a miniatures board game—zones should give a tactile sense of the<br />
environment, but at the point where you need something more than a cocktail<br />
napkin to lay it out, you’re getting too complicated.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can describe the area as bigger than a house, you can probably divide it into two or more zones—think of a cathedral or a shopping center parking lot.</li>
<li>If it’s separated by stairs, a ladder, a fence, or a wall, it could be divided zones, like two floors of a house.</li>
<li>“Above X” and “below X” can be different zones, especially if moving between them takes some doing—think of the airspace around something large, like a blimp.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re setting up your zones, note any situation aspects that could make<br />
moving between those zones problematic. They’ll be important later, when<br />
people want to move from zone to zone. If that means you need more situation<br />
aspects, add them now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda decides the warehouse needs to be multiple zones. The main floor is<br />
big enough, in her mind, for two zones, and the <span class="aspect">Heavy<br />
Crates</span> she mentioned earlier make it hard to freely move between them.</p>
<p>She knows there’s also a second floor ringing the inner walls, so she makes<br />
that an additional zone. She adds <span class="aspect">Ladder Access Only</span> to<br />
the scene.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, someone decides to run outside, she figures that can be<br />
a fourth zone, but she doesn’t think she needs any aspects for it.</p>
<p>She sketches the rough map on an index card for everyone to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/default/files/heavy-crates.png" /></p>
<h2 id="establishing-sides">Establishing Sides<a class="headerlink" href="#establishing-sides" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>It’s important to know everyone’s goal in a conflict before you start. People<br />
fight for a reason, and if they’re willing to do harm, it’s usually an urgent<br />
reason.</p>
<p>The normal assumption is that the player characters are on one side, fighting<br />
against NPCs who are in opposition. It doesn’t always have to be that way,<br />
however—PCs can fight each other and be allied with NPCs against each other.</p>
<p>Make sure everyone agrees on the general goals of each side, who’s on which<br />
side, and where everyone is situated in the scene (like who’s occupying which<br />
zone) when the conflict begins.</p>
<p>It might also help, GMs, to decide how those groups are going to “divvy up” to<br />
face one another—is one character going to get mobbed by the bad guy’s<br />
henchmen, or is the opposition going to spread itself around equally among the<br />
PCs? You might change your mind once the action starts, but if you have a<br />
basic idea, it gives you a good starting point to work from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our continuing warehouse fight example, the sides are obvious—Og and his<br />
buddies want to do in the PCs, and the PCs want to keep that from happening.</p>
<p>Ryan asks Amanda about finding the smuggled goods, and Amanda replies, “If<br />
you think you can sneak in a moment during the fight to look for them, go for<br />
it. We’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>The conflict starts with everyone on the main warehouse floor. Amanda<br />
decides that Og and one of his friends are going to go after Landon, two of<br />
the other thugs are going after Cynere, and the final one is going to chase<br />
after Zird.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="turn-order">Turn Order<a class="headerlink" href="#turn-order" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Your turn order in a conflict is based on your skills. In a physical conflict,<br />
compare your Notice skill to the other participants. In a mental conflict,<br />
compare your Empathy skill. Whoever has the highest gets to go first, and then<br />
everyone else in descending order.</p>
<p>If there’s a tie, compare a secondary or tertiary skill. For physical<br />
conflicts, that’s Athletics, then Physique. For mental conflicts, Rapport,<br />
then Will.</p>
<p>GMs, for a simple option, pick your most advantageous NPC to determine your<br />
place in the turn order, and let all your NPCs go at that time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere has a Notice of Good (+3), higher than everyone else, so she goes<br />
first.</p>
<p>Zird has a Notice of Average (+1), so he goes second.</p>
<p>Landon and Og both lack the Notice skill. Landon has Athletics at Good (+3),<br />
and Og has it at Fair (+2), so Landon goes third and Og goes last.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-exchange">The Exchange<a class="headerlink" href="#the-exchange" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Exchanges in a conflict are a little more complicated than in contests. In an<br />
exchange, every character gets a turn to take an action. GMs, you get to go<br />
once for every NPC you control in the conflict.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you’re going to be attacking another character or creating<br />
an advantage on your turn, because that’s the point of a conflict—take your<br />
opponent out, or set things up to make it easier to take your opponent out.</p>
<p>GMs, if you have a lot of nameless NPCs in your scene, feel free to have them<br />
use passive opposition to keep your dice rolling down. Also, consider <a href="../../fate-core/creating-and-playing-opposition" title="Using Mobs">using<br />
mobs</a><br />
instead of individual NPCs to keep things simple.</p>
<p>However, if you have a secondary objective in the conflict scene, you might<br />
need to roll an overcome action instead. You’ll encounter this most often if<br />
you want to move between zones but there’s a situation aspect in place making<br />
that problematic.</p>
<p>Regardless, you only get to make one skill roll on your turn in an exchange,<br />
unless you’re defending against someone else’s action—you can do that as many<br />
times as you want. You can even make defend actions on behalf of others, so<br />
long as you fulfill two conditions: it has to be reasonable for you to<br />
interpose yourself between the attack and its target, and you have to suffer<br />
the effects of any failed rolls.</p>
<h3 id="full-defense">Full Defense<a class="headerlink" href="#full-defense" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you want, you can forgo your action for the exchange to concentrate on<br />
defense. You don’t get to do anything proactive, but you do get to roll all<br />
defend actions for the exchange at a +2 bonus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first exchange of our warehouse fight, Cynere goes first. Lily has<br />
Cynere attack the thug that’s eyeing her. That’s her action for the<br />
exchange—she can still roll to defend whenever she needs to, but she can’t do<br />
anything else proactive until her next turn.</p>
<p>On Ryan’s turn, he has Zird do a full defense—normally, he’d be able to<br />
defend and get an action this exchange, but instead, he gets a +2 to his<br />
defense rolls until his next turn.</p>
<p>On Lenny’s turn, he has Landon create an advantage by placing an aspect on<br />
Og called Hemmed In, hoping to corner him between some crates. That’s his<br />
action for the exchange.</p>
<p>Amanda goes last, and she just has all of her NPCs attack their chosen<br />
targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="resolving-attacks">Resolving Attacks<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-attacks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A successful attack lands a hit equivalent to its shift value on a target. So<br />
if you get three shifts on an attack, you land a 3-shift hit.</p>
<p>If you get hit by an attack, one of two things happen: either you absorb the<br />
hit and stay in the fight, or you’re <strong>taken out</strong>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you have two options for absorbing hits to stay in the fight—you<br />
can take stress and/or consequences. You can also <a href="../../fate-core/conflicts" title="Concede A Conflict">concede a conflict</a> before you’re taken out, in<br />
order to preserve some control over what happens to your character.</p>
<p>If, for whatever reason, you want to forego your defense and take a hit (like,<br />
say, to interpose yourself in the path of an arrow that’s about to skewer your<br />
friend), you can.</p>
<p>Because you’re not defending, the attacker’s rolling against Mediocre (+0)<br />
opposition, which means you’re probably going to take a bad hit.</p>
<h3 id="stress">Stress<a class="headerlink" href="#stress" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>One of your options to mitigate the effect of a hit is to take stress.</p>
<p>The best way to understand stress is that it represents all the various<br />
reasons why you just barely avoid taking the full force of an attack. Maybe<br />
you twist away from the blow just right, or it looks bad but is really just a<br />
flesh wound, or you exhaust yourself diving out of the way at the last second.</p>
<p>Mentally, stress could mean that you just barely manage to ignore an insult,<br />
or clamp down on an instinctive emotional reaction, or something like that.</p>
<p>Stress boxes also represent a loss of momentum—you only have so many last-<br />
second saves in you before you’ve got to face the music.</p>
<p>On your character sheet, you have a number of stress boxes, each with a<br />
different shift value. By default, all characters get a 1-point and a 2-point<br />
box. You may get additional, higher-value stress boxes depending on some of<br />
your skills (usually <a href="../../fate-core/physique">Physique</a> and <a href="../../fate-core/will">Will<br />
</a>).</p>
<p>When you take stress, check off a stress box with a value equal to the shift<br />
value of the hit. If that box is already checked, check off a higher value<br />
box. If there is no higher available box, and you can’t take any consequences,<br />
you’re taken out of the conflict.</p>
<p>You can only check off one stress box per hit.</p>
<p>Remember that you have two sets of stress boxes! One of these is for physical<br />
stress, the other for mental; you’ll start with a 1-shift and a 2-shift box in<br />
each of these. If you take stress from a physical source, you check off a<br />
physical stress box. If it’s a mental hit, check off a mental stress box.</p>
<p>After a conflict, when you get a minute to breathe, any stress boxes you<br />
checked off become available for your use again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Og batters Landon with a whopping 3-shift hit on this exchange, wielding a<br />
giant club with spikes.</p>
<p>Looking at his character sheet, Lenny sees that he’s only got two stress<br />
boxes left—a 2-point and a 4-point.</p>
<p>Because his 3-point box is already checked, the hit must be absorbed by a<br />
higher-value box. He reluctantly checks off the 4-point box.</p>
<p>Amanda and Lenny describe the outcome—Landon gets his sword up just in time<br />
to barely deflect a blow that shatters a nearby crate, peppering Landon’s face<br />
with splintered wood. One inch closer, and it might have been his face that<br />
got splintered.</p>
<p>Landon has one more stress box on his sheet, a 2-shift box. That means his<br />
reserves are almost gone, and the next major hit he takes is going to hurt<br />
bad....</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="consequences">Consequences<a class="headerlink" href="#consequences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The second option you have for mitigating a hit is taking a consequence. A<br />
consequence is more severe than stress—it represents some form of lasting<br />
injury or setback that you accrue from the conflict, something that’s going to<br />
be a problem for your character after the conflict is over.</p>
<p>Consequences come in three levels of severity—mild, moderate, and severe. Each<br />
one has a different shift value: two, four, and six, respectively. On your<br />
character sheet, you have a number of available consequence slots, in this<br />
section:</p>
<p><strong>[Your character sheet image here] [Image to come. -Site editor]</strong></p>
<p>When you use a consequence slot, you reduce the shift value of the attack by<br />
the shift value of the consequence. You can use more than one consequence at a<br />
time if they’re available. Any of the hit’s remaining shifts must be handled<br />
by a stress box to avoid being taken out.</p>
<p>However, there’s a penalty. The consequence written in the slot is an aspect<br />
that represents the lasting effect incurred from the attack. The opponent who<br />
forced you to take a consequence gets a free invocation, and the aspect<br />
remains on your character sheet until you’ve recovered the consequence slot.<br />
While it’s on your sheet, the consequence is treated like any other aspect,<br />
except because the slant on it is so negative, it’s far more likely to be used<br />
to your character’s detriment.</p>
<p>Unlike stress, a consequence slot may take a long time to recover after the<br />
conflict is over. Also unlike stress, you only have one set of consequences;<br />
there aren’t specific slots for physical versus mental consequences. This<br />
means that, if you have to take a mild consequence to reduce a mental hit and<br />
your mild consequence slot is already filled with a physical consequence,<br />
you’re out of luck! You’re going to have to use a moderate or severe<br />
consequence to absorb that hit (assuming you have one left). The exception to<br />
this is the extra consequence slot you would get from a Superb (+5) Physique<br />
or Will is reserved for physical or mental harm, respectively.</p>
<p>Still, it’s better than being taken out, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere gets teamed up on by three of the thugs during this exchange, and<br />
with the help of a huge die roll and some situation aspects, they manage to<br />
land a 6-shift attack on her. She’s escaped harm so far this fight, and still<br />
has all her stress boxes and consequences available.</p>
<p>She has two ways to take the hit. She could take one severe consequence,<br />
which negates 6 stress. She could also take a moderate consequence (4 stress)<br />
and use her 2-point stress box.</p>
<p>She decides that it’s not likely she’s going to get hit for that much again,<br />
so she takes the severe consequence to keep her stress track open for smaller<br />
hits.</p>
<p>Amanda and Lily agree to call the severe consequence <span class="aspect">Nearly<br />
Gutted</span>. Cynere takes a wicked slash from one of the thugs’ swords,<br />
gritting her teeth through the pain....</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="naming-a-consequence">Naming a Consequence<a class="headerlink" href="#naming-a-consequence" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Here are some guidelines for choosing what to name a consequence:</p>
<p>Mild consequences don’t require immediate medical attention. They hurt, and<br />
they may present an inconvenience, but they aren’t going to force you into a<br />
lot of bed rest. On the mental side, mild consequences express things like<br />
small social gaffes or changes in your surface emotions. Examples:<br />
<span class="aspect">Black Eye</span>, <span class="aspect">Bruised Hand</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Winded</span>, <span class="aspect">Flustered</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Cranky</span>, <span class="aspect">Temporarily Blinded</span>.</p>
<p>Moderate consequences represent fairly serious impairments that require<br />
dedicated effort toward recovery (including medical attention). On the mental<br />
side, they express things like damage to your reputation or emotional problems<br />
that you can’t just shrug off with an apology and a good night’s sleep.<br />
Examples: <span class="aspect">Deep Cut</span>, <span class="aspect">First Degree Burn</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Exhausted</span>, <span class="aspect">Drunk</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Terrified</span>.</p>
<p>Severe consequences go straight to the emergency room (or whatever the<br />
equivalent is in your game)—they’re extremely nasty and prevent you from doing<br />
a lot of things, and will lay you out for a while. On the mental side, they<br />
express things like serious trauma or relationship-changing harm. Examples:<br />
<span class="aspect">Second-Degree Burn</span>, <span class="aspect">Compound Fracture</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Guts Hanging Out</span>, <span class="aspect">Crippling Shame</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Trauma-Induced Phobia</span>.</p>
<h3 id="what-skill-do-i-use-for-recovery">What Skill Do I Use For Recovery?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-skill-do-i-use-for-recovery" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In Hearts of Steel, physical recovery can only happen through the use of a<br />
Lore stunt, which Zird the Arcane has taken. This makes physical fights<br />
dangerous and suggests that actual medical training is quite rare. For mental<br />
recovery, use the Empathy skill.</p>
<p>If you want it to be easier to help people recover physically, you could add<br />
it as a default action to a skill. Lore is a good default option, but it could<br />
be seen as a function of Crafts, too. It might even be important enough in<br />
your game to add a Medic or Survival skill.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you want to restrict access to mental recovery, make it an<br />
Empathy or Rapport stunt, rather than having it built in to a skill.</p>
<h4 id="recovering-from-a-consequence">Recovering from a Consequence<a class="headerlink" href="#recovering-from-a-consequence" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In order to regain the use of a consequence slot, you have to recover from the<br />
consequence. That requires two things—succeeding at an action that allows you<br />
to justify recovery, and then waiting an appropriate amount of game time for<br />
that recovery to take place.</p>
<p>The action in question is an <a href="../../fate-core/four-
actions" title="Overcome An Obstacle">overcome action</a>; the obstacle is the consequence that you<br />
took. If it’s a physical injury, then the action is some kind of medical<br />
treatment or first aid. For mental consequences, the action may involve<br />
therapy, counseling, or simply a night out with friends.</p>
<p>The difficulty for this obstacle is based on the shift value of the<br />
consequence. Mild is Fair (+2), moderate is Great (+4), and severe is<br />
Fantastic (+6). If you are trying to perform the recovery action on yourself,<br />
increase the difficulty by two steps on the ladder.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the circumstances have to be appropriately free of<br />
distraction and tension for you to make this roll in the first place—you’re<br />
not going to clean and bandage a nasty cut while ogres are tromping through<br />
the caves looking for you. GMs, you’ve got the final judgment call.</p>
<p>If you succeed at the recovery action, or someone else succeeds on a recovery<br />
action for you, you get to rename the consequence aspect to show that it’s in<br />
recovery. So, for example, <span class="aspect">Broken Leg</span> could become<br />
<span class="aspect">Stuck in a Cast</span>, <span class="aspect">Scandalized</span> could<br />
become <span class="aspect">Damage Control</span>, and so on. This doesn’t free up the<br />
consequence slot, but it serves as an indicator that you’re recovering, and it<br />
changes the ways the aspect’s going to be used while it remains.</p>
<p>Whether you change the consequence’s name or not—and sometimes it might not<br />
make sense to do so—mark it with a star so that everyone remembers that<br />
recovery has started.</p>
<p>Then, you just have to wait the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a <strong>mild consequence</strong>, you only have to wait one whole <a href="../../fate-core/defining-scenes">scene</a> after the recovery action, and then you can remove the aspect and clear the slot.</li>
<li>For a <strong>moderate consequence</strong>, you have to wait one whole <a href="../../fate-core/scenes-sessions-scenarios">session</a> after the recovery action (which means if you do the recovery action in the middle of a session, you should recover sometime in the middle of next session).</li>
<li>For a <strong>severe consequence</strong>, you have to wait one whole <a href="../../fate-core/defining-scenarios">scenario</a> after the recovery action.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere ended up with the severe consequence <span class="aspect">Nearly<br />
Gutted</span> as the result of the fight.</p>
<p>Back at the inn, Zird attempts to bandage up the cut. He has a stunt called,<br />
“Scholar, Healer” which allows him to use his Lore skill for recovery<br />
obstacles. He makes his Lore roll at a difficulty of Fantastic (+6) and<br />

<p>This allows Cynere’s <span class="aspect">Nearly Gutted</span> aspect to be renamed<br />
<span class="aspect">Bandaged</span> and start the recovery process. After the next<br />
whole scenario, she’ll be able to erase that aspect from her sheet and use her<br />
severe consequence again in a subsequent conflict.</p>

<h3 id="potions-and-other-insta-healing">Potions and Other Insta-Healing<a class="headerlink" href="#potions-and-other-insta-healing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Many genres have some sort of mechanism by which characters can quickly<br />
recover from injuries. Fantasy settings have the ubiquitous healing potion or<br />
spell. Sci-fi has superscience dermal regenerators or biogel. Usually, these<br />
mechanisms exists because many games express injuries in terms of a constant<br />
numerical penalty that drastically affects a character’s effectiveness.</p>
<p>In Fate, however, a consequence is largely just like any other aspect. It only<br />
comes into play when someone pays a fate point to invoke it (after the initial<br />
free invoke, of course), or when it’s compelled.</p>
<p>At best, powerful healing should simply eliminate the need to roll for a<br />
recovery action, or should reduce the severity of a consequence by one level<br />
or more. So, a healing potion might turn a severe consequence into a moderate<br />
one, making the recovery time much shorter. The PC should have to spend at<br />
least one scene where the consequence could affect things, before you let it<br />
go away.</p>
<h4 id="extreme-consequences">Extreme Consequences<a class="headerlink" href="#extreme-consequences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>In addition to the normal set of mild, moderate, and severe consequences,<br />
every PC also gets one last-ditch option to stay in a fight—the <strong>extreme<br />
consequence</strong>. Between major milestones, you can only use this option once.</p>
<p>An extreme consequence will absorb up to 8-shifts of a hit, but at a very<br />
serious cost—<strong>you must replace one of your aspects (except the high concept,<br />
that’s off limits) with the extreme consequence</strong>. That’s right, an extreme<br />
consequence is so serious that taking it literally changes who you are.</p>
<p>Unlike other consequences, you can’t make a recovery action to diminish an<br />
extreme consequence—you’re stuck with it until your next major milestone.<br />
After that, you can rename the extreme consequence to reflect that you’re no<br />
longer vulnerable to the worst of it, as long as you don’t just switch it out<br />
for whatever your old aspect was. Taking an extreme consequence is a permanent<br />
character change; treat it as such.</p>
<h2 id="conceding-the-conflict">Conceding the Conflict<a class="headerlink" href="#conceding-the-conflict" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When all else fails, you can also just give in. Maybe you’re worried that you<br />
can’t absorb another hit, or maybe you decide that continuing to fight is just<br />
not worth the punishment. Whatever the reason, you can interrupt any action at<br />
any time before the roll is made to declare that you concede the conflict.<br />
This is super-important—once dice hit the table, what happens happens, and<br />
you’re either taking more stress, suffering more consequences, or getting<br />
taken out.</p>
<p>Concession gives the other person what they wanted from you, or in the case of<br />
more than two combatants, removes you as a concern for the opposing side.<br />
You’re out of the conflict, period.</p>
<p>But it’s not all bad. First of all, <strong>you get a fate point for choosing to<br />
concede</strong>. On top of that, if you’ve sustained any consequences in this<br />
conflict, you get an additional fate point for each consequence. These fate<br />
points may be used once this conflict is over.</p>
<p>Second of all, <strong>you get to avoid the worst parts of your fate</strong>. Yes, you<br />
lost, and the narration has to reflect that. But you can’t use this privilege<br />
to undermine the opponent’s victory, either—what you say happens has to pass<br />
muster with the group.</p>
<p>That can make the difference between, say, being mistakenly left for dead and<br />
ending up in the enemy’s clutches, in shackles, without any of your stuff—the<br />
sort of thing that can happen if you’re taken out instead. That’s not nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Og proves to be too much for Landon to handle in the warehouse conflict,<br />
having hit with several devastating attacks in the course of the fight.</p>
<p>Before Amanda’s next turn, Lenny says, “I concede. I don’t want to risk any<br />
more consequences.”</p>
<p>Landon’s taken both a mild and a moderate consequence. He gets a fate point<br />
for conceding, as well as two more fate points for the two consequences he<br />
took, giving him three total.</p>
<p>Amanda says, “So, what are you trying to avoid here?”</p>
<p>Lenny says, “Well, I don’t want to get killed or captured, for starters.”</p>
<p>Amanda chuckles and says, “Fair enough. So, we’ll say that Og knocks you out<br />
cold and doesn’t bother to finish you off, because he still has Cynere and<br />
Zird to deal with. He may even think you’re dead. I feel like the loss needs<br />
some more teeth, though. Hm...”</p>
<p>Ryan pipes up with, “How about he takes your sword as a trophy?”</p>
<p>Amanda nods. “Yeah, that’s good. He knocks you out, spits on you, and takes<br />
your sword.”</p>
<p>Lenny says, “Bastard! I’m so getting him back for that one...”</p>

<p>The following text is from a <a href="https://plus.google.com/116394742606298068145/posts/4dScLtq43oo">comment in the Fate Core Google+<br />
Community</a> by<br />
Leonard Balsera.</p>
<p>Concession, as a mechanic, specifically faces outward to the real people<br />
playing. It's explicitly about the parsing of narrative authority over the<br />
fate of the character post-conflict, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Characters do not concede. People do.</p>
<p>So it's basically like this:</p>
<p>The consequence of getting taken out is that the chief advocate for that<br />
character (GM included) gets no say over the fate of that character after that<br />
scene. Theoretically, anyone who takes anyone out in a physical conflict could<br />
follow that up with, "...and I kill you," and barring social contract<br />
disruptions in the group, that assertion stands.</p>
<p>If you concede before you get taken out, you as the chief advocate have the<br />
final word over the fate of the character after that scene. The bit that's up<br />
for negotiation is how we express the terms of your defeat in the fiction, but<br />
the chief advocate gets the last word.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the book makes that distinction pretty clear, and I think<br />
in practice it's pretty clear if you prioritize the rules over your own<br />
group's particular cultural expectations from prior RPG play. I'm biased about<br />
the text because I wrote it, and I know in practice that the degree people are<br />
gonna choose their local culture of play over the game as it's designed<br />
varies, and, like, that's okay. Do what you like and what's fun for you.</p>
<p>But for the folks who want to explore what emerges from hardcore RAW, here are<br />
some things that might help perspective-wise:</p>
<p>1.) Fate deliberately stands in contradiction to the tradition of playing out<br />
a conflict until its mechanical end point. If you don't want to lose control<br />
over the fate of your character, you should never fight until you're taken<br />
out, period.</p>
<p>2.) The GM is not exempt from the concession vs. taken out rule—like, part of<br />
the reason the rule exists is for GMs to preserve NPCs they want to use later.<br />
Fate explicitly prioritizes playing to find out what happens over playing to<br />
jump through the GM's hoops. If your plan hinges on an NPC's survival, GMs,<br />
you're probably bringing scenario prep ideas from other games into Fate.</p>
<p>3.) You have to fully justify all terms of a concession in the fiction. So in<br />
a scene where one of the terms is, "and the NPC escapes," part of the material<br />
you make up is why the PC's don't just keep up the pursuit. So if the player<br />
says, "Why don't I just jump out the window and go after them?" the response<br />
should be, "Good question. Why don't you just jump out the window and go after<br />
them?" and work together to make up why.</p>
<p>4.) Conflict is serious business, moreso than it may seem. It's a scene where<br />
you can lose authority over what happens to your character. Treating it as<br />
such elevates the stakes and tension of Fate play.</p>
<p>5.) The social contract trumps all rules. The fact that the GM will seldom<br />
respond to taking a PC out with, "...and the NPC kills you" isn't because the<br />
rules don't let her. Explicitly, the rules let her. She doesn't do that<br />
because she knows that would kill the fun for her players.</p>
<h2 id="getting-taken-out">Getting Taken Out<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-taken-out" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you don’t have any stress or consequences left to buy off all the shifts of<br />
a hit, that means you’re <strong>taken out</strong>.</p>
<p>Taken out is bad—it means not only that you can’t fight anymore, but that the<br />
person who took you out gets to decide what your loss looks like and what<br />
happens to you after the conflict. Obviously, they can’t narrate anything<br />
that’s out of scope for the conflict (like having you die from shame), but<br />
that still gives someone else a lot of power over your character that you<br />
can’t really do anything about.</p>
<h3 id="character-death">Character Death<a class="headerlink" href="#character-death" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>So, if you think about it, there’s not a whole lot keeping someone from<br />
saying, after taking you out, that your character dies. If you’re talking<br />
about a physical conflict where people are using nasty sharp weapons, it<br />
certainly seems reasonable that one possible outcome of defeat is your<br />
character getting killed.</p>
<p>In practice, though, this assumption might be pretty controversial depending<br />
on what kind of group you’re in. Some people think that character death should<br />
always be on the table, if the rules allow it—if that’s how the dice fall,<br />
then so be it.</p>
<p>Others are more circumspect, and consider it very damaging to their fun if<br />
they lose a character upon whom they’ve invested hours and hours of gameplay,<br />
just because someone spent a lot of fate points or their die rolls were<br />
particularly unlucky.</p>
<p>The latter approach is recommended, mainly for the following reason: most of<br />
the time, sudden character death is a pretty boring outcome when compared to<br />
putting the character through hell. On top of that, all the story threads that<br />
character was connected to just kind of stall with no resolution, and you have<br />
to expend a bunch of effort and time figuring out how to get a new character<br />
into play mid-stride.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there’s no room for character death in the game, however. It<br />
is recommended that you save that possibility for conflicts that are extremely<br />
pivotal, dramatic, and meaningful for that character—in other words, conflicts<br />
in which that character would knowingly and willingly risk dying in order to<br />
win. Players and GMs, if you’ve got the feeling that you’re in that kind of<br />
conflict, talk it out when you’re setting the scene and see how people feel.</p>
<p>At the very least, even if you’re in a hardcore group that invites the<br />
potential for character death on any taken out result, make sure that you<br />
telegraph the opponent’s lethal intent. GMs, this is especially important for<br />
you, so the players will know which NPCs really mean business, and can concede<br />
to keep their characters alive if need be.</p>
<h2 id="movement">Movement<a class="headerlink" href="#movement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In a conflict, it’s important to track where everyone is relative to one<br />
another, which is why the environment is divided into zones. Where you have<br />
zones, you have people trying to move around in them in order to get at one<br />
another or at a certain objective.</p>
<p>Normally, it’s no big deal to move from one zone to another—<strong>if there’s<br />
nothing preventing you from doing so, you can move one zone in addition to<br />
your action for the exchange.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to move more than one zone (up to anywhere else on the map), if a<br />
situation aspect suggests that it might be difficult to move freely, or if<br />
another character is in your way, then you must make an <a href="../../fate-core/four-actions">overcome</a> action using Athletics to move. This counts as<br />
your action for the exchange.</p>
<p>GMs, just as with other overcome rolls, you’ll set the difficulty. You might<br />
use the number of zones the character is moving or the situation aspects in<br />
the way as justification for how high you set passive opposition. If another<br />
character is impeding the path, roll active opposition and feel free to invoke<br />
obstructing situation aspects in aid of their defense.</p>
<p>If you fail that roll, whatever was impeding you keeps you from moving. If you<br />
tie, you get to move, but your opponent takes a temporary advantage of some<br />
kind. If you succeed, you move without consequence. If you succeed with style,<br />
you can claim a boost in addition to your movement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our continuing warehouse conflict, Cynere wants to go after one of Og’s<br />
thugs, who has started shooting arrows down from the second floor. That<br />
requires her to cross one zone to get to the access ladder for the second<br />
floor, and then climb it, making her opponent two zones away.</p>
<p>She’s currently mixing it up with a thug herself, whose Fight is at Fair<br />
(+2).</p>
<p>Lily tells Amanda her intent, and Amanda says, “Okay, the thug you’re<br />
fighting is going to try and keep you from getting away, so he’s going to<br />
provide active opposition.”</p>
<p>Cynere’s Athletics is Great (+4). She rolls and gets +0, for a Great result.<br />
The thug rolls his opposition, and rolls –1, for a result of Average (+1).<br />
That gives Cynere three shifts, and a success with style.</p>
<p>Lily and Amanda describe Cynere faking out the thug, vaulting over a crate,<br />
and taking the ladder two rungs at a time to get up top. She takes a boost,<br />
which she calls <span class="aspect">Momentum</span>.</p>
<p>The thug up top swallows hard, bringing his crossbow to bear...</p>

<h2 id="advantages-in-a-conflict">Advantages in a Conflict<a class="headerlink" href="#advantages-in-a-conflict" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Remember that aspects you create as advantages follow all the rules for<br />
<a href="http://www.faterpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Fate-
Core-SRD-OGL.html#Anchor-136">situation aspects</a>—the GM can use them to justify overcome actions,<br />
they last until they’re made irrelevant or the scene is over, and in some<br />
cases they represent as much a threat to you as an opponent.</p>
<p>When you create an advantage in a conflict, think about how long you want that<br />
aspect to stick around and whom you want to have access to it. It’s difficult<br />
for anyone besides you and your friends to justify using an advantage you<br />
stick to a character, but it’s also easier to justify getting rid of it—one<br />
overcome action could undo it. It’s harder to justify getting rid of an aspect<br />
on the environment (seriously, who is going to move that <span class="aspect">Huge<br />
Bookcase</span> you just knocked over?), but anyone in the scene could<br />
potentially find a reason to take advantage of it.</p>
<h3 id="cover-fire-and-other-impositions">Cover Fire and Other Impositions<a class="headerlink" href="#cover-fire-and-other-impositions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>When you’re trying to prevent someone else from getting attacked, the main way<br />
to do it is by creating an advantage. You can pass your buddy the invocation<br />
and make it harder to hit them.</p>
<p>You could also put yourself directly between the attack and the intended<br />
target, such that the bad guy has to get through you to get to your buddy.<br />
Then you’re just defending as normal and taking the stress and consequences<br />
yourself.</p>
<p>If you want to defend other people without directly interposing yourself<br />
between them and the attack, you’ll need a stunt.</p>
<p>In terms of options for advantages, the sky’s the limit. Pretty much any<br />
situational modifier you can think of can be expressed as an advantage. If<br />
you’re stuck for an idea, here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temporary Blinding</strong>: Throwing sand or salt in the enemy’s eyes is a classic action staple. This places a <span class="aspect">Blinded</span> aspect on a target, which could require them to get rid of the aspect with an overcome action before doing anything dependent on sight. <span class="aspect">Blinded</span> might also present opportunities for a compel, so keep in mind that your opponent can take advantage of this to replenish fate points.</li>
<li><strong>Disarming</strong>: You knock an opponent’s weapon away, disarming them until they can recover it. The target will need an overcome action to recover their weapon.</li>
<li><strong>Positioning</strong>: There are a lot of ways to use advantages to represent positioning, like <span class="aspect">High Ground</span> or <span class="aspect">Cornered</span>, which you can invoke to take advantage of that positioning as context demands.</li>
<li><strong>Winded and Other Minor Hurts</strong>: Some strikes in a fight are debilitating because they’re painful, rather than because they cause injury. Nerve hits, groin shots, and a lot of other “dirty fighting” tricks fall into this category. You can use an advantage to represent these, sticking your opponent with <span class="aspect">Pain-Blindness</span> or <span class="aspect">Stunned</span> or whatever, then following up with an attack that exploits the aspect to do more lasting harm.</li>
<li><strong>Taking Cover</strong>: You can use advantages to represent positions of cover and invoke them for your defense. This can be as general as <span class="aspect">Found Some Cover </span>or as specific as <span class="aspect">Behind the Big Oak Bar</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Altering the Environment</strong>: You can use advantages to alter the environment to your benefit, creating barriers to movement by scattering <span class="aspect">Loose Junk</span> everywhere, or setting things <span class="aspect">On Fire</span>. That last one is a favorite in Fate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-actions-in-a-conflict">Other Actions in a Conflict<a class="headerlink" href="#other-actions-in-a-conflict" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As stated above, you may find yourself in a situation where you want to do<br />
something else while your friends are fighting. You might be disarming a death<br />
trap, searching for a piece of information, or checking for hidden assailants.</p>
<p>In order to do this, GMs, set the player up with a modified form of challenge.<br />
One of the tasks is likely “defend yourself”—in any exchange where someone<br />
attacks you or tries to create an advantage on you, you must defend<br />
successfully in order to be able to take one of the other actions in the<br />
challenge. So long as no one has successfully attacked you or stuck an<br />
advantage on you, you can use your action to roll for one of the challenge<br />
goals.</p>
<h3 id="free-actions">Free Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#free-actions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes it just makes sense that your character is doing something else in<br />
conjunction with or as a step toward their action in an exchange. You quick-<br />
draw a weapon before you use it, you shout a warning before you kick in a<br />
door, or you quickly size up a room before you attack. These little bits of<br />
action are colorful description more than anything else, meant to add<br />
atmosphere to the scene.</p>
<p>GMs, don’t fall into the trap of trying to police every little detail of a<br />
player’s description. Remember, if there’s no significant or interesting<br />
opposition, you shouldn’t require a roll—just let the players accomplish what<br />
they say they do. Reloading a gun or fishing for something in your backpack is<br />
part of performing the action. You shouldn’t require any mechanics to deal<br />
with that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cynere is trying to get a door open so that she and her friends can escape<br />
into an ancient vault rather than fighting off endless hordes of temple<br />
guardians.</p>
<p>Amanda says, “Well, let’s call it a Fair (+2) Crafts action to get the door<br />
open, and a Fair (+2) Physique roll to push it open enough to slide through,<br />
because it’s one of those heavy vault doors. The other action is defending<br />
yourself.”</p>
<p>On that exchange, Cynere successfully defends against an attack, so she uses<br />
her action to pick the lock. She fails, and decides to succeed at a cost.<br />
Amanda figures the easiest thing is to hit her with a consequence because<br />
she’s in a fight. So she gets the door open, but not before one of the temple<br />
guardians gives her a <span class="aspect">Gouged Leg</span>.</p>
<p>On the next exchange, she fails to defend against an attack, so she doesn’t<br />
get to roll for the challenge.</p>
<p>On the third exchange, she defends and succeeds with style at the Physique<br />
roll to get the door open. She signals to her friends and takes a<br />
<span class="aspect">Head Start</span> boost, because it’s about to be a chase…</p>

<h2 id="ending-a-conflict">Ending a Conflict<a class="headerlink" href="#ending-a-conflict" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Under most circumstances, when all of the members of one side have either<br />
conceded the conflict or have been taken out, the conflict is over.</p>
<p>GMs, once you know a conflict has definitively ended, you can pass out all the<br />
fate points earned from concession. Players, take the fate points for when<br />
your aspects were invoked against you, make a note of whatever consequences<br />
you suffered in the fight, and erase any checks in your stress boxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After much struggle and insanity, the warehouse conflict is finally over.<br />
Amanda concedes the conflict on behalf of Og and his remaining thug, meaning<br />
that the PCs stay alive and can proceed to check out the smuggled goods they<br />
were interested in.</p>
<p>Because it was a concession, Og gets away to fight another day. Because<br />
Lenny conceded to Amanda in an earlier example, Og also gets away with<br />
Landon’s sword as a personal trophy.</p>
<p>Because Lenny conceded, he gets fate points. One for conceding, and another<br />
two for the mild and moderate consequences he took in the conflict. All the<br />
invocations used against him were free, so that’s all he gets. Three fate<br />
points.</p>
<p>Ryan gets two fate points, because Amanda let one of the thugs invoke his<br />
Not the Face! twice against him during the conflict.</p>
<p>Lily gets no fate points, because all the invocations against her were free,<br />
from advantages and boosts. Because she won, she doesn’t get awarded for the<br />
consequences she took.</p>

<p>You may find yourself in a conflict scene where the participants are no longer<br />
interested in or willing to harm one another, because of some change in the<br />
circumstances. If that happens, and there’s still more to resolve, you can<br />
transition straight into a contest or challenge as you need. In that case,<br />
hold off on awarding the end-of-conflict fate points and whatnot until you’ve<br />
also resolved the contest or challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an earlier example, Cynere managed to get a vault door open so the three<br />
PCs could escape an endless horde of temple guardians. They all decide to run<br />
and try to lose them.</p>
<p>Now, the guardians and the PCs have mutually opposing goals but can’t harm<br />
one another, so now it’s a contest. Instead of running the next exchange,<br />
Amanda just starts setting up for the chase.</p>
<p>Even though the PCs have some consequences and are due some fate points,<br />
they won’t get them until after they get away, or if they get caught.</p>
