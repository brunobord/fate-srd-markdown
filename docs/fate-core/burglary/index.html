<p>The Burglary skill covers your character’s aptitude for stealing things and<br />
getting into places that are off-limits.</p>
<p>In genres that rely on the use of a lot of technology, this skill also<br />
includes a proficiency in the related tech, allowing the character to hack<br />
security systems, disable alarm systems, and whatnot.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: As stated above, Burglary allows you to<br />
overcome any obstacle related to theft or infiltration. Bypassing locks and<br />
traps, pickpocketing and filching, covering your tracks, and other such<br />
activities all fall under the purview of this skill.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: You can case a location with<br />
Burglary, to determine how hard it will be to break into and what kind of<br />
security you’re dealing with, as well as discover any vulnerabilities you<br />
might exploit. You can also examine the work of other burglars to determine<br />
how a particular heist was done, and create or discover aspects related to<br />
whatever evidence they may have left behind.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Burglary isn’t used for attacks.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Same here. It’s not really a conflict<br />
skill, so there’s not a lot of opportunity to use it to defend</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Always a Way Out</strong>. +2 on Burglary rolls made to create an advantage whenever you’re trying to escape from a location.</li>
<li><strong>Security Specialist</strong>. You don’t have to be present to provide active opposition to someone trying to overcome security measures you put in place or worked on. (Normally, a character would roll against passive opposition for that.)</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talk the Talk</strong>. You can use Burglary in place of Contacts whenever you’re dealing specifically with other thieves and burglars.</p>
