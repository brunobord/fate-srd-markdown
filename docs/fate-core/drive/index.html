<h1 id="drive">Drive<a class="headerlink" href="#drive" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The Drive skill is all about operating vehicles and things that go fast.</p>
<p>Like <a href="../../fate-core/crafts">Crafts</a>, how the Drive skill appears in<br />
your games is going to depend a lot on how much action you intend to have<br />
inside of vehicles or other forms of transportation, and what kind of<br />
technology is available in your setting.</p>
<p>For example, a low-tech setting (like Hearts of Steel) might have Ride instead<br />
of Drive, because the main transportation is animal-based. A futuristic<br />
setting revolving around people in a space opera military might have Drive<br />
(for cars), Pilot (for starships), and Operate (for tanks or heavy military<br />
vehicles).</p>
<h3 id="different-vehicles-different-skills">Different Vehicles, Different Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#different-vehicles-different-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The advice is the same as for Crafts—don’t go nuts with reskinning this skill<br />
unless it makes a real, tangible difference in your game. Especially consider<br />
the option of having one skill that’s modified by stunts (see <a href="../../fate-core/building-stunts">Building Stunts<br />
</a>).</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span><strong>Overcome</strong>: Drive is the equivalent of <a href="../../fate-core/athletics">Athletics<br />
</a> when you’re in a vehicle—you use it to<br />
successfully accomplish movement in the face of difficult circumstances, like<br />
rough terrain, small amounts of clearance, or stunt driving. Obviously, Drive<br />
is also ripe for contests, especially chases and races.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span><strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: You can use Drive to<br />
determine the best way to get somewhere in a vehicle, and a good enough roll<br />
might allow you to learn features of the route that get expressed as aspects,<br />
or declare that you know a Convenient Shortcut or something similar.</p>
<p>You can also just read the Athletics description, and then make it about a<br />
vehicle. Advantages created using Drive often revolve around getting good<br />
positioning, doing a fancy maneuver (Did a Barrel Roll, anyone?), or putting<br />
your opponent in a bad spot.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span><strong>Attack</strong>: Drive isn’t usually used as an attack<br />
skill (though stunts can certainly alter this). If you want to ram a vehicle,<br />
you can attack with Drive, but you take the same shifts of harm you inflict.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span><strong>Defend</strong>: Avoiding damage to a vehicle in a physical<br />
conflict is one of the most common uses of Drive. You can also use it to<br />
defend against advantages being created against you or overcome actions of<br />
someone trying to move past you in a vehicle.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hard to Shake</strong>. +2 to Drive whenever you’re pursuing another vehicle in a chase scene.</li>
<li><strong>Pedal to the Metal</strong>. You can coax more speed out of your vehicle than seems possible. Whenever you’re engaged in any contest where speed is the primary factor (such as a chase or race of some kind) and you tie with your Drive roll, it’s considered a success.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ramming Speed!</strong> When ramming another vehicle, you ignore two shifts of damage. So if you ram and hit for four shifts, you only take two yourself.</p>
