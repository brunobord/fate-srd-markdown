<p>Start things off by being as unsubtle as possible—take one of your story<br />
questions, come up with something that will bring the question into sharp<br />
relief, and hit your players over the head with it as hard as you can. You<br />
don’t have to answer it right off the bat (though there’s nothing wrong with<br />
that, either), but you should show the players that the question demands an<br />
answer.</p>
<p>That way, you’re setting an example for the rest of the session and getting<br />
the momentum going, ensuring the players won’t dither around. Remember,<br />
they’re supposed to be proactive, competent people—give them something to be<br />
proactive and competent about right from the get-go.</p>
<p>If you’re in an ongoing campaign, you might need the first scenes of a session<br />
to resolve loose ends that were left hanging from a previous session. It’s<br />
okay to spend time on that, because it helps keep the sense of continuity<br />
going from session to session. As soon as there’s a lull in momentum, though,<br />
hit them with your opening scene fast and hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Arcane Conspiracy: The Opening Scene</p>
<p>Amanda mulls over her questions and thinks about what she wants as her<br />
opening scene. A couple of obvious suggestions come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enforcers from the Collegia show up at Zird’s door and serve him papers,<br />
demanding he come with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cynere receives the contract and job details from a mysterious employer,<br />
and must decide whether or not to sign.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She decides to go with the latter scene, because she figures that if Cynere<br />
rebuffs the contract and then finds out that Zird’s going to the Collegia<br />
anyway, it might create a fun scene where she tries to get the mysterious<br />
employer to reconsider. And even if she sticks to her guns, it’ll establish<br />
whether or not they’ll have to deal with any drama on the way there, as the<br />
mysterious employer’s lackeys harass them on the way.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean she’s going to just toss the scene with Zird aside—she’s<br />
just going to save it for a follow-up to the first scene.</p>

<h2 id="powerful-session-starting-ninja-gm-trick">Powerful Session-Starting Ninja GM Trick<a class="headerlink" href="#powerful-session-starting-ninja-gm-trick" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Asking the players to contribute something to the beginning of your first<br />
scene is a great way to help get them invested in what’s going on right off<br />
the bat. If there’s anything that’s flexible about your opening prompt, ask<br />
your players to fill in the blanks for you when you start the scene. Clever<br />
players may try to use it as an opportunity to push for a compel and get extra<br />
fate points right off the bat—we like to call this sort of play “awesome.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s look at our example scenes above. The prompts don’t specify where the<br />
PCs are when they get confronted with their first choices. So, Amanda might<br />
start the session by asking Ryan, “Where exactly isZird when the brute squad<br />
from the Collegia comes looking for him?”</p>
<p>Now, even if Ryan just replies with “in his sanctuary,” you’ve solicited his<br />
participation and helped him set the scene. But Ryan is awesome, so what he<br />
says instead is, “Oh, probably at the public baths, soaking after a long day<br />
of research.”</p>
<p>“Perfect!” says Amanda, and holds out a fate point. “So, it’d make sense<br />
that yourRivals in the Collegia Arcana would have divined precisely the right<br />
time to catch you away from all your magical implements and gear, right?”</p>
<p>Ryan grins and takes the fate point. “Yeah, that sounds about right.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, you can also just have your opening scenario hooks count as “pre-<br />
loaded” compels, and hand out some fate points at the start of a session to<br />
start the PCs off with a spot of trouble they have to deal with immediately.<br />
This helps low-refresh players out and can kickstart the spending of fate<br />
points right off the bat. Make sure your group is okay with giving you carte<br />
blanche authority to narrate them into a situation, though—some players find<br />
the loss of control problematic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda wants to start the players off with a number of fate points off the<br />
bat, so at the beginning of the session, she says to the players:</p>
<p>“Zird, it’s bad enough when your <span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia<br />
Arcana</span> give you trouble, but when they pretend to be peasants in the<br />
local watering hole, get you drunk, and start a bar fight so they can haul you<br />
somewhere secluded, it’s even worse. You wake up with a five-alarm hangover<br />
and a black eye—someone punched you in the face!” (2 fate points, for Rivals<br />
and <span class="aspect">Not the Face!</span>)</p>
<p>“Landon, I know <span class="aspect">Smashing is Always an Option</span>, but how<br />
are you going to explain what happened when you tried to fix the wagon while<br />
everyone else was away?” (1 fate point for Smashing.)</p>
<p>“Cynere, whoever decided to make you this contract offer knows you pretty<br />
well. They’ve included several large gems along with the contract. Problem is,<br />
you also know what noble house they were stolen from, and there’s no doubt<br />
you’ll be a wanted woman if you don’t sign—and you’re infamous enough that you<br />
know no one’s going to believe how you came by them.” (2 fate points for<br />
<span class="aspect">Infamous Girl with Sword</span> and <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny<br />
Things</span>.)</p>
