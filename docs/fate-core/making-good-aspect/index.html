<p>Because aspects are so important to the game, it’s important to make the best<br />
aspects you can. So, how do you know what a good aspect is?</p>
<p>The best aspects are <strong>double-edged, say more than one thing, and keep the<br />
phrasing simple.</strong></p>
<h2 id="double-edged">Double-Edged<a class="headerlink" href="#double-edged" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Players, good aspects offer a clear benefit to your character while also<br />
providing opportunities to complicate their lives or be used to their<br />
detriment.</p>
<p>An aspect with a double-edge is going to come up in play more often than a<br />
mostly positive or negative one. You can use them frequently to be awesome,<br />
and you’ll be able to accept more compels and gain more fate points.</p>
<p>Try this as a litmus test—list two ways you might invoke the aspect, and two<br />
ways someone else could invoke it or you could get a compel from it. If the<br />
examples come easily to mind, great! If not, add more context to make that<br />
aspect work or put that idea to the side and come up with a new aspect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s look at an aspect like <span class="aspect">Computer Genius</span>. The<br />
benefits of having this aspect are pretty obvious—any time you’re hacking or<br />
working with technology, you could justify invoking it. But it doesn’t seem<br />
like there’s a lot of room for that aspect to work against you. So, let’s<br />
think of a way we can spice that up a bit.</p>
<p>What if we change that aspect to <span class="aspect">Nerdy McNerdson</span>? That<br />
still carries the connotations that would allow you to take advantage of it<br />
while working with computers, but it adds a downside—you’re awkward around<br />
people. This might mean that you could accept compels to mangle a social<br />
situation, or someone might invoke your aspect when a fascinating piece of<br />
equipment distracts you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GMs, this is just as true of your game and situation aspects. Any feature of a<br />
scene you call out should be something that either the PCs or their foes could<br />
use in a dramatic fashion. Your game aspects do present problems, but they<br />
also should present ways for the PCs to take advantage of the status quo.</p>
<h2 id="say-more-than-one-thing">Say More Than One Thing<a class="headerlink" href="#say-more-than-one-thing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Earlier, it was noted several things that a <a href="../..
/fate-core/aspects-fate-points" title="Aspects">character aspect</a> might describe: personality traits,<br />
backgrounds, relationships, problems, possessions, and so forth. The best<br />
aspects overlap across a few of those categories, because that means you have<br />
more ways to bring them into play.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s look at a simple aspect that a soldier might have: <span class="aspect">I Must<br />
Prove Myself</span>. You can invoke this whenever you’re trying to do<br />
something to gain the approval of others or demonstrate your competence.<br />
Someone might compel it to bait you into getting into a fight you want to<br />
avoid, or to accept a hardship for the sake of reputation. So we know it has a<br />
double edge, so far so good.</p>
<p>That’ll work for a bit, but eventually this aspect will run out of steam. It<br />
says just one thing about the character. Either you’re trying to prove<br />
yourself, or this aspect isn’t going to come up.</p>
<p>Now tie that aspect in with a relationship to an organization:<br />
<span class="aspect">The Legion Demands I Prove Myself</span>. Your options open up a<br />
great deal. Not only do you get all the content from before, but you’ve<br />
introduced that the Legion can make demands of you, can get you into trouble<br />
by doing things you get blamed for, or can send NPC superiors to make your<br />
life difficult. You can also invoke the aspect when dealing with the Legion,<br />
or with anyone else who might be affected by the Legion’s reputation.<br />
Suddenly, that aspect has a lot more going on around it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GMs, for your situation aspects, you don’t have to worry about this as much,<br />
because they’re only intended to stick around for a scene. It’s much more<br />
important for game and character aspects to suggest multiple contexts for use.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><del><span class="aspect">I Must Prove Myself</span></del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="aspect">The Legion Demands I Prove Myself</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clear-phrasing">Clear Phrasing<a class="headerlink" href="#clear-phrasing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Because aspects are phrases, they come with all the ambiguities of language.<br />
If no one knows what your aspect means, it won’t get used enough.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say you have to avoid poetic or fanciful expression.<br />
<span class="aspect">Just a Simple Farmboy</span> isn’t quite as fetching as<br />
<span class="aspect">Child of Pastoral Bliss</span>. If that’s the tone your game is<br />
going for, feel free to indulge your linguistic desires.</p>
<p>However, don’t do this at the expense of clarity. Avoid metaphors and<br />
implications, when you can get away with just saying what you mean. That way,<br />
other people don’t have to stop and ask you during play if a certain aspect<br />
would apply, or get bogged down in discussions about what it means.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s look at <span class="aspect">Memories, Wishes, and Regrets</span>. There’s<br />
something evocative about the phrase. It suggests a kind of melancholy about<br />
the past. But as an aspect, I don’t really know what it’s supposed to do. How<br />
does it help you? What are the memories of? What did you wish for? Without<br />
some concrete idea of what the aspect’s referring to, invoking and compelling<br />
it is pretty much impossible.</p>
<p>Suppose we talk about this some, and you specify that you were going for<br />
this idea that your character was scarred from years spent in the setting’s<br />
last great war. You killed people you didn’t want to kill, saw things you<br />
didn’t want to see, and pretty much had all your hope of returning to a normal<br />
life taken away.</p>
<p>I think this is all fantastic, and I suggest we call it <span class="aspect">Scars<br />
from the War</span>. Less poetic, maybe, but it directly references all the<br />
stuff you’re talking about, and gives me ideas about people from your past I<br />
may be able to bring back into your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re wondering if your aspect is unclear, ask the people at the table<br />
what they think it means.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><del><span class="aspect">Memories, Wishes, and Regrets</span></del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="aspect">Scars from the War</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="if-you-get-stuck">If You Get Stuck<a class="headerlink" href="#if-you-get-stuck" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Now you know what makes for a good aspect, but that doesn’t narrow down your<br />
potential choices any—you still have a nearly infinite set of topics and ideas<br />
to choose from.</p>
<p>If you’re still stuck about what to choose, here are some tips to make things<br />
a little easier on you.</p>
<h3 id="sometimes-its-better-not-to-choose">Sometimes, It’s Better Not to Choose<a class="headerlink" href="#sometimes-its-better-not-to-choose" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you can’t think of an aspect that really grabs you and the other people at<br />
the table, you’re better off leaving that space blank, or just keeping<br />
whatever ideas you had scribbled in the margins. Sometimes it’s much easier to<br />
wait for your character to get into play before you figure out how you want to<br />
word a particular aspect.</p>
<p>So when in doubt, leave it blank. Maybe you have a general idea of the aspect<br />
but don’t know how to phrase it, or maybe you just have no idea. Don’t worry<br />
about it. There’s always room during the game to figure it out as you go.</p>
<p>The same thing is true if you have more than one idea that seems juicy, but<br />
they don’t work together and you don’t know which one to pick. Write them all<br />
down in the margins and see which one seems to really sing in play. Then fill<br />
the space in later, with the one that gets the most mileage.</p>
<h3 id="always-ask-what-matters-and-why">Always Ask What Matters and Why<a class="headerlink" href="#always-ask-what-matters-and-why" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It was said above that aspects tell you why something matters in the game and<br />
why someone should care about it. This is your primary compass and guide to<br />
choosing the best possible aspect. When in doubt, always ask: what do we<br />
really care about here, and why?</p>
<p>The events of the <a href="../../fate-core/phase-trio" title="Phase Trio">phases</a><br />
should help you figure out what your aspect should be. Don’t try to summarize<br />
the events of the phase or anything like that with your aspect—remember, the<br />
point is to reveal something important about the character. Again, ask<br />
yourself what really matters about the phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the outcome? Is that important?</li>
<li>Did the character develop any important relationships or connections during this phase?</li>
<li>Does the phase help establish anything important about the character’s personality or beliefs?</li>
<li>Did the phase give the character a reputation?</li>
<li>Did the phase create a problem for the character in the game world?</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume that each question ends with “for good or ill”—these features,<br />
relationships, and reputations aren’t necessarily going to be positive, after<br />
all. Developing a relationship with a nemesis is as juicy as developing one<br />
with your best friend.</p>
<p>If there’s more than one option, poll the other players and GM to see what<br />
they find interesting. Remember, you should all be helping each other out—the<br />
game works best if everyone’s a fan of what everyone else is doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During Cynere’s <a href="../../fate-core/phase-trio">phase three</a>, Lily<br />
states that she complicated Zird’s story by showing up at an opportune moment<br />
and stealing the artifact that Zird stole from his rivals. Eventually the<br />
artifact returns to Zird’s hands.</p>
<p>She’s trying to tease out what the best aspect would be, and she doesn’t<br />
have a whole lot of information to go on. Going through the questions above,<br />
we see a lot of potential options—she showed off her underhandedness, she<br />
definitely suggested a relationship with Zird of some kind, and Zird’s rivals<br />
might now have a beef with her as well.</p>
<p>Lily polls the rest of the group, and after some talking, everyone seems to<br />
be pretty enthused about Cynere having some kind of aspected connection to<br />
Zird—they did all grow up in the same village, after all. She decides on<br />
<span class="aspect">I’ve Got Zird’s Back</span>, because it’s specific enough to be<br />
invoked and compelled, but leaves room for development later on in the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="vary-it-up">Vary It Up<a class="headerlink" href="#vary-it-up" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You don’t want all your aspects to describe the same kind of thing. Five<br />
relationships means that you can’t use your aspects unless one of them is in<br />
play, but five personality traits means that you have no connection to the<br />
game world. If you’re stuck on what to pick for an aspect, looking at what<br />
kinds of things your other aspects describe may help you figure out which way<br />
to go for the current phase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lenny ends up with <span class="aspect">Disciple of the Ivory Shroud</span> and<br />
<span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat</span> as Landon’s high concept and<br />
trouble. So far, this is a pretty straightforward character—a violent type<br />
whose mouth and demeanor are always getting him into trouble.</p>
<p>Lenny does his <a href="../../fate-core/phase-trio">phase one</a> and explains<br />
to us that Landon was a miscreant and street rat that grew up practically as<br />
an orphan—his parents were around, but never really paid too much attention to<br />
him or spent effort reining him in. He eventually decided to enlist in the<br />
town militia after someone saved him from a clobbering in a bar fight and<br />
suggested he do something worthwhile with his life.</p>
<p>Amanda asks him what really matters about this phase, and Lenny ponders a<br />
bit. Landon’s first two aspects are heavy on personal description—he doesn’t<br />
have a lot of relationships yet. So Lenny focuses on that and decides he wants<br />
a connection to the guy who pulled him into the militia.</p>
<p>They end up naming that guy Old Finn, Landon ends up with the aspect<br />
<span class="aspect">I Owe Old Finn Everything</span>, and Amanda now has a new NPC to<br />
play with.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="let-your-friends-decide">Let Your Friends Decide<a class="headerlink" href="#let-your-friends-decide" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The game works best if everyone is invested in what everyone else is<br />
doing—collaboration is at the heart of the game, and it'll probably be said a<br />
lot more throughout this site.</p>
<p>You always have the option, especially with aspects, of simply asking the GM<br />
and other players to come up with something on your behalf. Pitch them the<br />
events of the phase, and ask them the same questions they’re going to be<br />
asking of you. What matters to them? What are they excited about? Do they have<br />
suggestions about how to make the events of the phase more dramatic or<br />
intense? What aspect do they think would be most interesting or appropriate?</p>
<p>You have the final decision as to what your character’s aspects are, so don’t<br />
look at it as giving up control. Look at it as asking your ever-important fan<br />
club and audience what they want to see, and using their suggestions to<br />
jumpstart your own train of thought. If everyone has a bit of input on<br />
everyone else’s characters, the game will benefit from that sense of mutual<br />
investment.</p>
