<p>You’re probably already familiar with the idea of a setting, but in short,<br />
it’s everything that the characters interact with, such as people,<br />
organizations and institutions, technology, strange phenomena, and mysteries<br />
(crime, intrigue, and cosmic or historical legend). These are the sort of<br />
things that characters want to engage with, are forced to engage with, look to<br />
for help, or stand in their way.</p>
<p>If you’re using a setting that already exists, from a movie, novel, or other<br />
game book, then many of these ideas are ready for you to use. Of course,<br />
you’ll also likely add your own spin on things: new organizations or different<br />
mysteries to uncover.</p>
<p>If you’re inventing a setting, you have more work cut out for you. It’s beyond<br />
the scope of this chapter to tell you how to make a setting. If you choose to<br />
do that it is assumed that you already know how to build one. (Besides, we<br />
live in a vast world of media. See <a href="http://tvtropes.org/">tvtropes.org</a> if you<br />
don’t believe us.) One word of advice, though—don’t try to invent too much up<br />
front. As you’ll see in the Game Creation section, you’re going to be<br />
generating a lot of ideas just through the process of game and character<br />
creation, so the details will come in time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amanda, Lenny, Lily, and Ryan sit down to talk about the setting. They’re<br />
all jonesing for a low fantasy game, as Lenny and Lily have recently read some<br />
of the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories. So they pitch “two guys and a girl<br />
with swords.” The world is “vaguely medieval, Earth with the serial numbers<br />
filed off.”</p>
<p>Ryan suggests “guy and girl with swords, and guy without a sword” so that<br />
there’s a difference between the two guys. Also, because he wants to play<br />
someone who is more bookish (for contrast). Everyone’s on board with this, and<br />
they move on.</p>
