<p>You might have already come up with an NPC or group of NPCs who is/are<br />
responsible for what’s going on when you made up your problem, but if you<br />
haven’t, you need to start putting together the cast of characters who are the<br />
key to answering your story questions. You also need to nail down their<br />
motivations and goals, why they’re standing in opposition to the PCs’ goals,<br />
and what they’re after.</p>
<p>At the very least, you should be able to answer the following questions for<br />
each named NPC in your scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does that NPC need? How can the PCs help her get that, or how are the PCs in the way?</li>
<li>Why can’t the NPC get what she needs through legitimate means? (In other words, why is this need contributing to a problem?)</li>
<li>Why can’t she be ignored?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever you can, try and consolidate NPCs so that you don’t have too many<br />
characters to keep track of. If one of your opposition NPCs is serving only<br />
one purpose in your scenario, consider getting rid of him and folding his role<br />
together with another NPC. This not only reduces your workload, but it also<br />
allows you to develop each NPC’s personality a bit more, making him more<br />
multi-dimensional as you reconcile his whole set of motives.</p>
<p>For each NPC that you have, decide whether you need to make them a supporting<br />
or main. Stat them up according to the guidelines given in <a href="../../fate-core/running-game">Running the Game<br />
</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Arcane Conspiracy: Opposition</p>
<p>Amanda looks over the story questions and thinks of NPCs she’ll need in<br />
order to answer them. She makes a list of the obvious suspects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cynere’s mysterious employer (not appearing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chief arbiter for the Collegia Arcana (supporting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cynere’s competitor for the Jewel (supporting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A barrister who isn’t part of the conspiracy (supporting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A corrupt barrister, and the one that Zird’s rivals want to set him up<br />
with (supporting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Collegia wizard who engineered the conspiracy to bring Zird down<br />
(main)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s six NPCs, four supporting, one main, and one that isn’t going to be<br />
in the scenario—she really doesn’t want to drop any details on who’s hiring<br />
Cynere yet. She also doesn’t really want to keep track of five NPCs, so she<br />
starts looking for opportunities to consolidate.</p>
<p>One pairing that immediately strikes her is making Cynere’s competitor and<br />
the neutral barrister into the same person, whom she names Anna. Anna might<br />
not be involved in this conspiracy, but clearly, there’s a more complicated<br />
motive at work. What’s going on with her? Amanda ultimately decides that<br />
Anna’s motives are beneficent; she’s secreting the Jewel away to keep it out<br />
of the hands of more corrupt elements in the Collegia’s infrastructure. She<br />
doesn’t know anything about Cynere and will mistake her for an agent of those<br />
corrupt elements until they clear the air.</p>
<p>Then she decides that the chief arbiter and the architect of the conspiracy<br />
are the same—he didn’t trust anyone else to stick the final nail in Zird’s<br />
coffin, so he made sure he’d be appointed arbiter over the trial. Amanda likes<br />
this because his political power makes him a formidable opponent to<br />
investigate and gives him a powerful lackey in the form of the corrupt<br />
barrister. But why does he have it in for Zird in the first place?</p>
<p>She further decides that his motives aren’t personal, but he’s getting ready<br />
to do some stuff that will rock the foundations of the Collegia, and he knows<br />
that as a misfit in that organization, Zird is one of the most likely<br />
candidates to resist him. So it’s basically a preemptive strike.</p>
<p>As for the corrupt barrister, the first thing that comes to mind is a<br />
pathetic, sniveling toady who is totally in the arbiter’s pocket. But she<br />
wants to add a measure of depth to him, so she also decides that the arbiter<br />
has blackmail material on him, which helps to ensure his loyalty. She doesn’t<br />
know what that info is yet, but she’s hoping that nosy PCs will help her<br />
figure it out through a story detail later.</p>
<p>She names the arbiter Lanthus, and the corrupt barrister Pight. Now she has<br />
her NPCs, and she goes about making their sheets.</p>

<p>When you’re establishing your NPCs for your scenario, you don’t have to have<br />
everything set in stone when you get to the table—whatever you don’t know, you<br />
can always establish by letting the advantages the players create become the<br />
NPCs’ aspects.</p>
