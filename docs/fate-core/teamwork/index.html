<p>Characters can help each other out on actions. There are two versions of<br />
helping in Fate—combining skills, for when you are all putting the same kind<br />
of effort into an action (like using Physique together to push over a<br />
crumbling wall), and stacking advantages, for when the group is setting a<br />
single person up to do well (like causing multiple distractions so one person<br />
can use Stealth to get into a fortress).</p>
<p>When you combine skills, figure out who has the highest skill level among the<br />
participants. Each other participant who has at least an Average (+1) in the<br />
same skill adds a +1 to the highest person’s skill level, and then only the<br />
lead character rolls. So if you have three helpers and you’re the highest, you<br />
roll your skill level with a +3 bonus.</p>
<p>If you fail a roll to combine skills, all of the participants share in the<br />
potential costs—whatever complication affects one character affects all of<br />
them, or everyone has to take consequences. Alternatively, you can impose a<br />
cost that affects all the characters the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuing with our temple chase example, because it’s group vs. group,<br />
everyone decides it’d be easier to just combine skills.</p>
<p>Of the three PCs, Cynere has the highest Athletics, at Great (+4). Landon<br />
has Good (+3) Athletics and Zird has Average (+1) Athletics, so they each<br />
contribute +1. Cynere rolls the contest on behalf of the PCs at Fantastic<br />
(+6).</p>
<p>Amanda’s temple guardians only have Average (+1) Athletics, but there are<br />
five of them, so they roll Superb (+5) for the purposes of the contest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you stack advantages, each person takes a create an advantage action as<br />
usual, and gives whatever free invocations they get to a single character.<br />
Remember that multiple free invocations from the same aspect can stack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zird and Cynere want to set Landon up for an extremely big hit on Tremendor,<br />
the much-feared giant of the Northern Wastes.</p>
<p>Both Cynere and Zird roll to create an advantage on their turns, resulting<br />
in three free invocations on a <span class="aspect">Flashy Distraction</span> they<br />
make from Zird’s magical fireworks (which succeeded to create the advantage)<br />
and Cynere’s glancing hits (which succeeded with style to add two more free<br />
invocations).</p>
<p>They pass those to Landon, and on his turn, he uses them all for a gigantic<br />
+6 to his attack.</p>

<p>"Some people are critical of the teamwork rules in Fate; depending on the day<br />
of the week, I’m one of them", says Ryan Macklin, one of the authors of Fate.<br />
In his article <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2015/08
/revising-teamwork-in-fate/">Revising Teamwork in Fate</a> he offers up some seasoned thinking on Teamwork<br />
Rules.</p>
