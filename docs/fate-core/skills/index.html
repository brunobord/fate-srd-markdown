<h2 id="pick-and-rate-your-characters-skills">Pick and rate your character’s skills.<a class="headerlink" href="#pick-and-rate-your-characters-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Once you have mapped out your character’s phases and chosen aspects, it’s time<br />
to pick skills. You’ll find descriptions and details for each skill in the<br />
<a href="../../fate-core/skills-stunts" title="Skills &amp; Stunts">Skills and Stunts</a><br />
section.</p>
<p>Your skills form a pyramid, with a single skill rated at Great (+4)—which is<br />
referred to as the peak skill—and more skills at each lower rating on the<br />
ladder going down to Average (+1):</p>
<ul>
<li>One Great (+4) skill</li>
<li>Two Good (+3) skills</li>
<li>Three Fair (+2) skills</li>
<li>Four Average (+1) skills</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-veterans-why-the-pyramid">For Veterans: Why The Pyramid?<a class="headerlink" href="#for-veterans-why-the-pyramid" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you’ve played <em>The Dresden Files RPG</em>, you know that skill columns are used<br />
for that instead of the pyramid.</p>
<p>In this build of Fate, character creation was designed to be as quick and<br />
accessible as possible, so the pyramid is standard. If you want to use the<br />
columns, go ahead—you get 20 skill points.</p>
<p>Skill columns didn’t completely go away. It’s just <a href="../../fate-core/advancement-change">reserved for advancement<br />
</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-skill-cap">The Skill Cap<a class="headerlink" href="#the-skill-cap" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>By default, Great (+4) is the highest rated skill PCs start with. As<br />
characters advance, they can improve beyond this cap, but it’s more difficult<br />
than improving skills rated below the cap (see <a href="../../fate-core/advancement-change">Major Milestones</a>).</p>
<p>If you’re making a game about superheroes, pandimensional creatures, mythic<br />
gods or other beyond-human characters, feel free to set the tip of the skill<br />
pyramid—and thus the cap—at Superb (+5) or Fantastic (+6).</p>
<p>The number of skills you get should be relative to the size of the skill list.<br />
Our default skill list has 18 skills, and the Great pyramid gives you a rating<br />
in 10 of them, which means every character has some capability in over half of<br />
the total number of things you can do, and there’s room for six PCs to peak<br />
(as in, to choose their three top skills) without overlap. You can tweak this<br />
for individual games, especially if you adjust the skill cap. Just keep in<br />
mind that bigger pyramids mean more overlap between characters, unless your<br />
game has a longer skill list.</p>
<p>Mediocre (+0) is the default for any skill you do not take. Sometimes, a skill<br />
will state that it’s unavailable if a character didn’t take it; in those<br />
cases, it’s not even at Mediocre.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ryan knows that Zird’s not like the other PCs in terms of skills, so he<br />
looks to distance Zird from them as much as possible. The group has decided<br />
that Zird’s magic is going to work off his Lore skill, so he’s naturally going<br />
to focus on that.</p>
<p>He takes Lore as Zird’s peak skill, followed by Crafts and Rapport—for a<br />
wizard, Zird considers himself a fairly social sort. Ryan takes Athletics,<br />
Will, and Investigate because he figures Zird will need them in his line of<br />
work, and a smattering of other skills either because neither of his friends<br />
have them, or because he wants a positive score in them when everyone’s<br />
separated. That ends up being Fight, Resources, Contacts, and Notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> a few skills have special benefits, notably those skills that affect the number of <a href="../../fate-core/stress-consequences" title="Stress &amp; Consequences">stress boxes and consequences</a> you have available. If you know you want a certain number of those, put those skills on the pyramid first.</p>
