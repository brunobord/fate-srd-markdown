<h1 id="start-playing">Start Playing<a class="headerlink" href="#start-playing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>These are the basic things you need to know to play Fate. The following<br />
sections go into greater detail on everything covered above, and will show you<br />
how to get your game off the ground.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../fate-core/game-creation">Game Creation</a> chapter takes you through the process of setting up your game, so that should probably be your next stop. Then <a href="../../fate-core/character-creation">Character Creation</a> will show you how to make the characters you’ll play.</li>
<li>Players, you’ll eventually want to read <a href="../../fate-core/actions-outcomes">Actions and Outcomes</a> and <a href="../../fate-core/long-game">The Long Game</a>, to help you get a better handle on the nuts and bolts of doing stuff and developing your character during play.</li>
<li>
<p>GMs, you’re going to want to familiarize yourselves with the whole book, but <a href="../../fate-core/running-game">Running the Game</a> and <a href="../../fate-core/scenes-sessions-scenarios">Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios</a> are of particular importance to you.</p>
</li>

<p><a href="../../fate-core/fate-points">« Fate Points</a></p>
