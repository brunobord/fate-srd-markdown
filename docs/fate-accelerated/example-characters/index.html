<p>Here are four sample characters that you can use as-is or use as inspiration<br />
for your own characters.</p>

<p>Reth is 14 years of age. He has dark brown skin and dark hair that he wears in<br />
thick dreadlocks. He wears light, loose-fitting clothing and sandals, and he’s<br />
a skilled martial artist. He’s the most powerful Suncaller to be born in<br />
generations; he can magically call forth the power of fire. Originally from a<br />
town in the vast Andral Desert, he and his friends took a stand against the<br />
invading Steel Empire and have been living on the run since.</p>
