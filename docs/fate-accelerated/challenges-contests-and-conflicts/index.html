<h1 id="challenges-contests-and-conflicts">Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-contests-and-conflicts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>We’ve talked about the four actions (create an advantage, overcome, attack,<br />
and defend) and the four outcomes (fail, tie, succeed, and succeed with<br />
style). But in what framework do those happen?</p>
<p>Usually, when you want to do something straightforward—swim across a raging<br />
river, hack someone’s cell phone—all you need to do is make one overcome<br />
action <a href="../../fate-accelerated/being-
gamemaster" title="Being the Gamemaster">against a difficulty level</a> that the GM sets. You look at your outcome<br />
and go from there.</p>
<p>But sometimes things are a little more complex.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>challenge</strong> is a series of overcome and create an advantage actions that<br />
you use to resolve an especially complicated situation. Each overcome action<br />
deals with one task or part of the situation, and you take the individual<br />
results together to figure out how the situation resolves.</p>
<p>To set up a challenge, decide what individual tasks or goals make up the<br />
situation, and treat each one as a separate overcome roll.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, one character may be required to make several<br />
rolls, or multiple characters may be able to participate. GMs, you aren’t<br />
obligated to announce all the stages in the challenge ahead of time—adjust the<br />
steps as the challenge unfolds to keep things exciting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PCs are the crew of a ship caught in a storm. They decide to press on<br />
and try to get to their destination despite the weather, and the GM suggests<br />
this sounds like a challenge. Steps in resolving this challenge could be<br />
calming panicky passengers, repairing damaged rigging, and keeping the ship on<br />
the right heading.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="contests">Contests<a class="headerlink" href="#contests" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When two or more characters are competing against one another for the same<br />
goal, but not directly trying to hurt each other, you have a contest. Examples<br />
include a car chase, a public debate, or an archery tournament.</p>
<p>A contest proceeds in a series of exchanges. In an exchange, every participant<br />
takes one overcome action to determine how well they do in that leg of the<br />
contest. Compare your result to everyone else’s.</p>
<p>If you got the highest result, you win the exchange—you score a victory (which<br />
you can represent with a tally or check mark on scratch paper) and describe<br />
how you take the lead. If you succeed with style, you mark two victories.</p>
<p>If there’s a tie, no one gets a victory, and an unexpected twist occurs. This<br />
could mean several things, depending on the situation—the terrain or<br />
environment shifts somehow, the parameters of the contest change, or an<br />
unanticipated variable shows up and affects all the participants. The GM<br />
<a href="../../fate-accelerated/aspects-
fate-points" title="Aspects &amp; Fate Points">creates a new situation aspect </a>reflecting this change and puts it into<br />
play.</p>
<p>The first participant to achieve three victories wins the contest.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts<a class="headerlink" href="#conflicts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Conflicts are used to resolve situations where characters are trying to harm<br />
one another. It could be physical harm (a sword fight, a wizard’s duel, a<br />
battle with laser blasters), but it could also be mental harm (a shouting<br />
match, a tough interrogation, a magical psychic assault).</p>

<li>Set the scene.</li>
<li>Determine turn order.</li>
<li>Start the first exchange.</li>
<li>On your turn, take an action.</li>
<li>On other people’s turns, defend against or respond to their actions as necessary.</li>
<li>At the end of everyone’s turn, start a new exchange or end the conflict.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-the-scene" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Establish what’s going on, where everyone is, and what the environment is<br />
like. Who is the opposition? The GM should write a couple of situation aspects<br />
on sticky notes or index cards and place them on the table. Players can<br />
suggest situation aspects, too.</p>
<p>The GM also establishes <strong>zones</strong>, loosely defined areas that tell you where<br />
characters are. You determine zones based on the scene and the following<br />
guidelines:</p>
<p>Generally, you can interact with other characters in the same zone—or in<br />
nearby zones if you can justify acting at a distance (for example, if you have<br />
a ranged weapon or magic spell).</p>
<p>You can move one zone for free. An action is required to move if there’s an<br />
obstacle along the way, such as someone trying to stop you, or if you want to<br />
move two or more zones. It sometimes helps to sketch a quick map to illustrate<br />
zones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thugs are attacking the characters in a house. The living room is one zone,<br />
the kitchen another, the front porch another, and the yard a fourth. Anyone in<br />
the same zone can easily throw punches at each other. From the living room,<br />
you can throw things at people in the kitchen or move into the kitchen as a<br />
free action, unless the doorway is blocked. To get from the living room to the<br />
front porch or yard requires an action.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="determine-turn-order">Determine Turn Order<a class="headerlink" href="#determine-turn-order" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Your turn order in a conflict is based on your approaches. In a physical<br />
conflict, compare your Quick approach to the other participants’—the one with<br />
the fastest reflexes goes first. In a mental conflict, compare your Careful<br />
approach—attention to detail will warn you of danger. Whoever has the highest<br />
approach gets to go first, and then everyone else goes in descending order.<br />
Break ties in whatever manner makes sense, with the GM having the last word.</p>
<p>GMs, it’s simplest if you pick your most advantageous NPC to determine your<br />
place in the turn order, and let all your NPCs go at that time. But if you<br />
have a good reason to determine turn order individually for all your NPCs, go<br />
right ahead.</p>
<h3 id="exchanges">Exchanges<a class="headerlink" href="#exchanges" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Next, each character takes a turn in order. On their turn, a character can<br />
take one of the <a href="../../fate-accelerated/how-do-stuff-
outcomes-actions-and-approaches" title="Outcomes, Actions, &amp; Approaches">four actions</a>. Resolve<br />
the action to determine the outcome. The conflict is over when only one side<br />
has characters still in the fight.</p>
