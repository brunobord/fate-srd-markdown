<p>When you’re hit by an attack, the severity of the hit is the difference<br />
between the attack roll and your defense roll; we measure that in <strong>shifts</strong>.<br />
For instance, if your opponent gets +5 on their attack and you get a +3 on<br />
your defense, the attack deals a two shift hit (5 – 3 = 2).</p>
<p>Then, one of two things happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>You suffer <strong>stress and/or consequences</strong>, but you stay in the fight.</li>
<li>You get <strong>taken out</strong>, which means you’re out of the action for a while.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stress-consequences-the-30-second-version">Stress &amp; Consequences: The 30-Second Version<a class="headerlink" href="#stress-consequences-the-30-second-version" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Each character starts with three stress boxes.</li>
<li>Severity of hit (in shifts) = Attack Roll – Defense Roll</li>
<li>When you take a hit, you need to account for how that hit damages you. One way to absorb the damage is to take stress; you can check one stress box to handle some or all of a single hit. You can absorb a number of shifts equal to the number of the box you check: one for Box 1, two for Box 2, three for Box 3.</li>
<li>You may also take one or more consequences to deal with the hit, by marking off one or more consequence slots and writing a new aspect for each one. Mild consequence = 2 shifts; moderate = 4 shifts; severe = 6 shifts.</li>
<li>If you can’t (or decide not to) handle the entire hit, you’re taken out. Your opponent decides what happens to you.</li>
<li>Giving in before your opponent’s roll allows you to control how you exit the scene. You also get one or more fate points for doing this!</li>
<li>Stress and mild consequences vanish at the end of the scene, provided you get a chance to rest. Other consequences take longer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-stress">What Is Stress?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-stress" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you get hit and don’t want to be taken out, you can choose to take stress.</p>
<p>Stress represents you getting tired or annoyed, taking a superficial wound, or<br />
some other condition that goes away quickly.</p>
<p>Your character sheet has a <strong>stress track</strong>, a row of three boxes. When you<br />
take a hit and check a stress box, the box absorbs a number of shifts equal to<br />
its number: one shift for Box 1, two for Box 2, or three for Box 3.</p>
<p><strong>You can only check one stress box for any single hit</strong>, but you can check a stress box and take one or more consequences at the same time. You can’t check a stress box that already has a check mark in it!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-consequences">What Are Consequences?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-consequences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Consequences are new aspects that you take to reflect being seriously hurt in<br />
some way. Your character sheet has three slots where you can write<br />
consequences. Each one is labeled with a number: 2 (mild consequence), 4<br />
(moderate consequence), or 6 (severe consequence). This represents the number<br />
of shifts of the hit the consequence absorbs. You can mark off as many of<br />
these as you like to handle a single hit, but only if that slot was blank to<br />
start with. If you already have a moderate consequence written down, you can’t<br />
take another one until you do something to make the first one go away!</p>
<p>A major downside of consequences is that each consequence is a new aspect that<br />
your opponents can invoke against you. The more you take, the more vulnerable<br />
you are. And just like situation aspects, the character that creates it (in<br />
this case, the character that hit you) gets one free invocation on that<br />
consequence. They can choose to let one of their allies use the free<br />
invocation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s say that you get hit really hard and take a 4-shift hit. You check Box<br />
2 on your stress track, which leaves you with 2 shifts to deal with. If you<br />
can’t, you’re taken out, so it’s time for a consequence. You can choose to<br />
write a new aspect in the consequence slot labeled 2—say,<br />
<span class="aspect">Sprained Ankle</span>. Those final 2 shifts are taken care of and<br />
you can keep fighting!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re unable to absorb all of a hit’s shifts—by checking a stress box,<br />
taking consequences, or both—you’re taken out.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-i-get-taken-out">What Happens When I Get Taken Out?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-when-i-get-taken-out" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you get taken out, you can no longer act in the scene. Whoever takes you<br />
out narrates what happens to you. It should make sense based on how you got<br />
taken out—maybe you run from the room in shame, or maybe you get knocked<br />
unconscious.</p>
<h2 id="giving-in">Giving In<a class="headerlink" href="#giving-in" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If things look grim for you, you can <strong>give in</strong> (or <strong>concede</strong> the<br />
fight)—but you have to say that’s what you’re going to do beforeyour opponent<br />
rolls their dice.</p>
<p>This is different than being taken out, because you get a say in what happens<br />
to you. Your opponent gets some major concession from you—talk about what<br />
makes sense in your situation—but it beats getting taken out and having no say<br />
at all.</p>
<p>Additionally, you get one fate point for conceding, and one fate point for<br />
each consequence you took in this conflict. This is your chance to say, “You<br />
win this round, but I’ll get you next time!” and get a tall stack of fate<br />
points to back it up.</p>
<h2 id="getting-better-recovering-from-stress-and-consequences">Getting Better—Recovering from Stress and Consequences<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-better-recovering-from-stress-and-consequences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>At the end of each scene, clear all of your stress boxes. Recovery from a<br />
consequence is a bit more complicated; you need to explain how you recover<br />
from it—whether that’s an ER visit, taking a walk to calm down, or whatever<br />
makes sense with the consequence. You also need to wait an appropriate length<br />
of time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mild consequence</strong>: Clear it at the end of the scene, provided you get a chance to rest.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate consequence</strong>: Clear it at the end of the next session, provided it makes sense within the story.</li>
<li><strong>Severe consequence</strong>: Clear it at the end of the <a href="../../fate-accelerated/being-gamemaster" title="Being the Gamemaster">scenario</a>, provided it makes sense within the story.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="renaming-moderate-and-severe-consequences">Renaming Moderate and Severe Consequences<a class="headerlink" href="#renaming-moderate-and-severe-consequences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Moderate and severe consequences stick around for a while. Therefore, at some<br />
point you may want to change the name of the aspect to better fit what’s going<br />
on in the story. For instance, after you get some medical help,<br />
<span class="aspect">Painful Broken Leg</span> might make more sense if you change it<br />
to <span class="aspect">Hobbling on Crutches</span>.</p>
