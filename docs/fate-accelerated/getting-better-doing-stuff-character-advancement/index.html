<p>People change. Your skills sharpen as you practice them. Your life experiences<br />
accumulate and shape your personality.Fate Accelerated Edition reflects that<br />
with character advancement, which allows you to change your aspects, add or<br />
change stunts, and raise your approach bonuses. You do this when your<br />
character reaches a milestone.</p>
<h2 id="milestones">Milestones<a class="headerlink" href="#milestones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Stories in TV shows, comic books, movies, and even video games usually<br />
continue from episode to episode, season to season. It took Frodo three big<br />
books to take the Ring to the fiery mountain. It took Aang three seasons to<br />
defeat the Fire Lord. You get the idea. FAE can tell those kinds of stories;<br />
you play many game sessions in a row using the same characters—this is often<br />
called a <strong>campaign</strong>—and the story builds on itself. But within these long<br />
stories, there are shorter story arcs, like single episodes of a TV show or<br />
single issues of a comic, where shorter stories are told and wrapped up. FAE<br />
can do that too, even within a longer campaign.</p>
<p>In FAE, we call those wrap-ups <strong>milestones</strong>—whether they’re small ones for<br />
short stories, or really big ones at the end of many sessions of play. FAE<br />
recognizes three types of milestones, and each one allows you to change your<br />
character in certain ways.</p>
<h3 id="minor-milestones">Minor Milestones<a class="headerlink" href="#minor-milestones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>minor milestone</strong> usually occurs at the end of a session of play, or when<br />
one piece of a story has been resolved. Rather than making your character more<br />
powerful, this kind of milestone is more about changing your character, about<br />
adjusting in response to whatever’s going on in the story if you need to.<br />
Sometimes it won’t really make sense to take advantage of a minor milestone,<br />
but you always have the opportunity in case you need to.</p>
<p>After a minor milestone, you can choose to do one (and only one) of the<br />
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch the ratings of any two approaches.</li>
<li>Rename one aspect that isn’t your high concept.</li>
<li>Exchange one stunt for a different stunt.</li>
<li>Choose a new stunt (and adjust your refresh, if you already have three stunts).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if you have a moderate consequence, check to see if it’s been around for<br />
two sessions. If so, you can clear it.</p>
<h3 id="significant-milestones">Significant Milestones<a class="headerlink" href="#significant-milestones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>significant milestone</strong> usually occurs at the end of a <a href="../../fate-accelerated/being-gamemaster" title="Being the Gamemaster">scenario</a> or the<br />
conclusion of a big plot event (or, when in doubt, at the end of every two or<br />
three sessions). Unlike minor milestones, which are primarily about change,<br />
significant milestones are about learning new things—dealing with problems and<br />
challenges has made your character generally more capable at what they do.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefit of a minor milestone, you also gain both of the<br />
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a severe consequence that’s been around for at least two sessions, you can clear it.</li>
<li>Raise the bonus of one approach by one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="raising-approach-bonuses">Raising Approach Bonuses<a class="headerlink" href="#raising-approach-bonuses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>When you raise the bonus of an approach, there’s only one rule you need to<br />
remember: you can’t raise an approach bonus above Superb (+5).</p>
<h3 id="major-milestones">Major Milestones<a class="headerlink" href="#major-milestones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>Major milestones</strong> should only occur when something happens in the campaign that shakes it up a lot—the end of a big story arc, the final defeat of a main NPC villain, or any other large-scale change that reverberates around your game world.</p>
<p>These milestones are about gaining more power. The challenges of yesterday<br />
simply aren’t sufficient to threaten these characters anymore, and the threats<br />
of tomorrow will need to be more adept, organized, and determined to stand<br />
against them.</p>
<p>Achieving a major milestone confers the benefits of a significant milestone<br />
and a minor milestone. In addition, you may doall of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take an additional point of refresh, which you may immediately use to purchase a stunt if you wish.</li>
<li>
<p>Rename your character’s high concept (optional).</p>
