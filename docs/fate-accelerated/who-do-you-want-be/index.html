<p>Once you’ve decided what kind of story you’ll be telling in your game, you<br />
decide who your character is—what they look like, what they’re good at, and<br />
what they believe.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-characters-can-i-play">What Kind of Characters Can I Play?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-kind-of-characters-can-i-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Think about the setting that you’ve decided to play in and make that your main<br />
guide. Are you playing in a school for young sorcerers? Play a young sorcerer!<br />
Are you playing space pilots fighting an evil empire? Play a space pilot! Make<br />
sure your character has a reason to interact and cooperate with the characters<br />
the other players are making.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to start writing stuff down. Grab a pencil and a copy of the<br />
<a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/" title="Download a
Character Sheet from Evil Hat">character sheet</a>. Some people like to use form-fillable PDFs<br />
on a laptop or tablet computer. Any of that’s fine, but you definitely want<br />
something that lets you erase and change.</p>
<h3 id="aspects-in-a-nutshell">Aspects in a Nutshell<a class="headerlink" href="#aspects-in-a-nutshell" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>An aspect is a word, phrase, or sentence that describes something centrally<br />
important to your character. It can be a motto your character lives by, a<br />
personality quirk, a description of a relationship you have with another<br />
character, an important possession or bit of equipment your character has, or<br />
any other part of your character that is vitally important.</p>
<p>Aspects allow you to change the story in ways that tie in with your<br />
character’s tendencies, skills, or problems. You can also use them to<br />
<a href="../../fate-accelerated/aspects-
fate-points" title="Aspects &amp; Fate Points">establish facts about the setting</a>, such as the presence of magic or the<br />
existence of a useful ally, dangerous enemy, or secret organization.</p>
<p>Your character will have a handful of aspects (between three and five),<br />
including a high concept and a trouble. Aspects are discussed in detail in<br />
<a href="../../fate-accelerated/aspects-fate-
points">Aspects and Fate Points</a>—but for now, this should help you get the idea.</p>
<h3 id="high-concept">High Concept<a class="headerlink" href="#high-concept" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>First, decide on your character’s high concept. This is a single phrase or<br />
sentence that neatly sums up your character, saying who you are, what you do,<br />
what your “deal” is. When you think about your high concept, try to think of<br />
two things: how this aspect could help you, and how it might make things<br />
harder for you. Good high concept aspects do both.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>: <span class="aspect">Feline Captain of Cirrus Skimmer</span>; <span class="aspect">Suncaller of the Andral Desert</span>; <span class="aspect">Chief Field Agent of IGEMA</span></p>
<h3 id="trouble">Trouble<a class="headerlink" href="#trouble" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Next, decide on the thing that always gets you into trouble. It could be a<br />
personal weakness, or a recurring enemy, or an important obligation—anything<br />
that makes your life complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>: <span class="aspect">Steel Assassins Want Me Dead</span>; <span class="aspect">Cast Now</span>, <span class="aspect">Ask Questions Later</span>; <span class="aspect">Gotta Look Out for My Little Brother</span></p>
<h3 id="another-aspect">Another Aspect<a class="headerlink" href="#another-aspect" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Now compose another aspect. Think of something really important or interesting<br />
about your character. Are they the strongest person in their hometown? Do they<br />
carry a mighty sword known through history? Do they talk too much? Are they<br />
filthy rich?</p>
<h3 id="optional-one-or-two-additional-aspects">Optional: One or Two Additional Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-one-or-two-additional-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you wish, you may create one or two more aspects. These aspects might<br />
describe your character’s relationship with other player characters or with an<br />
NPC. Or, like the third aspect you composed above, it might describe something<br />
especially interesting about your character.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can leave one or both of these aspects blank right now and<br />
fill them in later, after the game has started.</p>
<h3 id="name-and-appearance">Name and Appearance<a class="headerlink" href="#name-and-appearance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Describe your character’s appearance and give them a name.</p>
<h3 id="creating-characters-the-30-second-version">Creating Characters: The 30-Second Version<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-characters-the-30-second-version" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Write two aspects: a high concept and a trouble.</li>
<li>Write another aspect.</li>
<li>Give your character a name and describe their appearance.</li>
<li><a href="../../fate-accelerated/how-do-stuff-outcomes-actions-and-approaches">Choose approaches</a>.</li>
<li>Set your refresh to 3.</li>
<li>You may write up to two more aspects and <a href="../../fate-accelerated/stunts">choose a stunt</a> if you wish, or you may do that during play.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="approaches">Approaches<a class="headerlink" href="#approaches" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Choose your <strong>approaches</strong>.</p>
<p>Approaches are descriptions of how you accomplish tasks. Everyone has the same<br />
six approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Careful</li>
<li>Clever</li>
<li>Flashy</li>
<li>Forceful</li>
<li>Quick</li>
<li>Sneaky</li>
</ul>
<p>Each approach is rated with a bonus.<strong> Choose one at Good (+3), two at Fair<br />
(+2), two at Average (+1), and one at Mediocre (+0)</strong>. You can improve these<br />
later. What each approach means and how you use them can be found in <a href="../../fate-accelerated
/how-do-stuff-outcomes-actions-and-approaches">How to<br />
Do Stuff: Outcomes, Approaches, and Actions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-ladder">The Ladder<a class="headerlink" href="#the-ladder" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Fate uses a ladder of adjectives and numbers to rate a character’s approaches,<br />
the result of a roll, difficulty ratings for simple checks, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s the ladder:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>+8</th>
<th>Legendary</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>+7</td>
<td>Epic</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+6</td>
<td>Fantastic</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+5</td>
<td>Superb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+4</td>
<td>Great</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+3</td>
<td>Good</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+2</td>
<td>Fair</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>+1</td>
<td>Average</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>Mediocre</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td>Poor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-2</td>
<td>Terrible</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Your approaches can say a lot about who you are. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Brute</strong>:<br />
Forceful +3, Careful and Flashy +2, Sneaky and Quick +1, Clever +0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The All-Star</strong>:<br />
Quick +3, Forceful and Flashy +2, Clever and Careful +1, Sneaky +0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Trickster</strong>:<br />
Clever +3, Sneaky and Flashy +2, Forceful and Quick +1, Careful +0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Guardian</strong>:<br />
Careful +3, Forceful and Clever +2, Sneaky and Quick +1, Flashy +0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Thief</strong>:<br />
Sneaky +3, Careful and Quick +2, Clever and Flashy +1, Forceful +0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Swashbuckler</strong>:<br />
Flashy +3, Quick and Clever +2, Forceful and Sneaky +1, Careful +0</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stunts-and-refresh">Stunts and Refresh<a class="headerlink" href="#stunts-and-refresh" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>A stunt is a special trait that changes the way an approach works for your character.</strong> Generally, stunts give you a bonus (almost always +2) to a certain approach when used with a particular action under specific circumstances. Find out more about stunts in <a href="../../fate-accelerated/stunts" title="Stunts">Stunts</a>. Choose one stunt to start, or you can wait and add a stunt during the game. Later, when your character advances, you can choose more.</p>
<p>Your refresh is the number of fate points you begin each game session<br />
with—unless you ended the previous session with more unspent fate points than<br />
your refresh, in which case you start with the number you had left last time.<br />
By default, your refresh starts at three and is reduced by one for each stunt<br />
after the first three you choose—essentially, your first three stunts are<br />
free! As your character advances, you’ll get opportunities to add to your<br />
refresh. Your refresh may never go below one.</p>
<h3 id="how-many-stunts">How Many Stunts?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-many-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>By default, FAE suggests choosing one stunt to start with.</p>
<p>However, if this is your first time playing a Fate game, you might find it<br />
easier to pick your first stunt after you’ve had a chance to play a bit, to<br />
give you an idea of what a good stunt might be. Just add your stunt during or<br />
after your first game session.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re an experienced Fate gamer, you might look ahead<br />
and discover that, just like in Fate Core, your character is entitled to three<br />
free stunts before it starts costing you refresh. In that case, let the least<br />
experienced member of your game group be your guide; if someone is new to the<br />
game and only takes one to start with, that’s what everyone should do. If<br />
you’re all experienced, and you want to start with more powerful characters,<br />
just take all three to start and off you go.</p>
