<p><strong>Stunts</strong> are tricks, maneuvers, or techniques your character has that change how an approach works for your character. Generally this means <a href="../../fate-accelerated/how-do-stuff-outcomes-actions-and-approaches" title="Outcomes, Actions, &amp; Approaches">you get a bonus in certain situations</a>, but sometimes it gives you some other ability or characteristic. A stunt can also reflect specialized, high-quality, or exotic equipment that your character has access to that gives them a frequent edge over other characters.</p>
<p>There’s no definitive list of stunts that you pick from; much like aspects,<br />
everyone composes their own stunts. There are two basic templates to guide you<br />
in composing your stunts, so you do have something to work from.</p>
<p>The first type of stunt gives you a +2 bonus when you use a certain approach<br />
in a certain situation. Use this template:</p>
<p>Because I <strong>[describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of<br />
gear, or are otherwise awesome]</strong>, I get a +2 when I <strong>[pick one: Carefully,<br />
Cleverly, Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily][pick one: attack, defend,<br />
create advantages, overcome]</strong> when <strong>[describe a circumstance]</strong>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because I am a Smooth Talker, I get a +2 when I Sneakily create<br />
advantages when I’m in conversation with someone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because I am a Lover of Puzzles, I get a +2 when I Cleverly overcome<br />
obstacles when I am presented with a puzzle, riddle, or similar conundrum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because I am a World-Class Duelist, I get a +2 when I Flashily attack<br />
when engaged in a one-on-one swordfight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because I have a Big Kite Shield, I get a +2 when I Forcefully defend<br />
when I use my shield in close combat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, if the circumstance is especially restrictive, you can apply the<br />
stunt to both the create an advantage action and the overcome action.</p>
<p>The second type of stunt lets you make something true, do something cool, or<br />
otherwise ignore the usual rules in some way. Use this template:</p>
<p>Because I <strong>[describe some way that you are exceptional, have a cool bit of<br />
gear, or are otherwise awesome]</strong>, once per game session I can <strong>[describe<br />
something cool you can do]</strong>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because I am Well Connected, once per game session I can find a helpful<br />
ally in just the right place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because I am Quick on the Draw, once per game session I can choose to go<br />
first in a physical conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because I can Run Circles Around a Leopard, once per game session I can<br />
show up anywhere I want to, provided I could run there, no matter where I<br />
started.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These templates exist to give you an idea of how stunts should be constructed,<br />
but don’t feel constrained to follow them exactly if you have a good idea. If<br />
you’d like to read more about the construction of stunts, see <a href="../../fate-core/skills-stunts" title="Skills &amp; Stunts (in Fate
Core)">Skills and<br />
Stunts</a> in Fate Core.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble coming up with a stunt, give the <a href="../../stunt-maker/">Stuntmaker</a> a go. It will generate random Fate Core style stunts to<br />
inspire you! (Just be sure to vet them with the table before using them.)</p>
