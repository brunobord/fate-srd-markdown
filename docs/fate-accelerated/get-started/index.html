    <p>Fate Accelerated</p>
<h1 id="get-started">Get Started!<a class="headerlink" href="#get-started" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Remember those books where the teenage wizards struggle against the Dark Lord<br />
of Evil? That movie where the dwarves fight to recapture their mountain home<br />
from a dragon? That animated TV show about mystical knights and their army of<br />
clones righting wrongs across the galaxy?</p>
<p>Aren’t those <em>awesome</em>?</p>
<p>Here’s your chance to put yourself in the heroes’ shoes in stories like those.</p>
<p><em>Fate Accelerated Edition</em> is a tabletop roleplaying game, where you and your<br />
friends gather around and tell stories full of danger, excitement, and<br />
adventure. You might have played games similar to this before—Dungeons &amp;<br />
Dragons is a very popular one—but don’t worry if you haven’t; this booklet<br />
will guide you through it.</p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll need to play:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three to five people</strong>. One of you will be the <strong>gamemaster</strong>, the others <strong>players</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Fate Dice™</strong>, at least four, preferably four per person. These are a special kind of six-sided dice that are marked on two sides with a plus symbol <span class="fate_font">+</span>, two sides with a minus symbol <span class="fate_font">-</span>, and two sides are blank <span class="fate_font">0</span>. You can get these dice from many hobby and game stores, often under their original name—Fudge dice. They are called Fate Dice on this site, but you can call them whatever you like. Evil Hat offers Fate Dice for sale at <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/"><a href="http://www.evilhat.com">www.evilhat.com</a></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't want to use Fudge dice, you don't have to–any set of regular six-<br />
sided dice will work. If you're using regular dice, you read 5 or 6 as<br />
<span class="fate_font">+</span>, 1 or 2 as <span class="fate_font">-</span>, and 3 or 4 as<br />
<span class="fate_font">0</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Deck of Fate</strong> is an alternative to Fate Dice. It’s a deck of cards that mimics the probability of Fate Dice, and it’s designed to be used in the same way Fate Dice are. The Deck of Fate can be bought <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/deck-of-fate/">in the Evil Hat store</a> and there is also <a href="http://deckoffate.hiddenachievement.com/">an app</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character sheets</strong>, one for each player. You can download these from <a href="http://www.evilhat.com/"><a href="http://www.evilhat.com">www.evilhat.com</a></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Index cards</strong> or <strong>sticky notes</strong> or similar slips of paper.</li>
<li><strong>Tokens for fate points.</strong> These can be poker chips, beads, pennies, or anything similar. Get a handful—about 30 or 40.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, let’s talk about how to use Fate Accelerated to tell stories together.</p>
