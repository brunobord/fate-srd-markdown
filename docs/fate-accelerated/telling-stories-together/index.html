<p>So you’ve gathered your friends, your dice, and your index cards, and you’re<br />
ready to play <em>Fate Accelerated Edition</em> (it’ll be called FAE from now on).<br />
Time to tell some stories!</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-mean-tell-stories">What Do You Mean, “Tell Stories”?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-you-mean-tell-stories" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>FAE is all about telling stories. You create a group of characters and follow<br />
them through some imaginary adventure that you all take turns telling little<br />
parts of.</p>
<p>Think about a movie, video game, or TV show you like where the characters go<br />
on adventures—something like <em>The Legend of Korra _or</em> Star Wars <em>or</em> The<br />
Avengers_ or the <em>Zelda</em> games or <em>Doctor Who _or _The Lord of the Rings</em>. Now<br />
imagine a similar sort of story, where you and your friends around the table<br />
make the decisions for the characters as they move through the story, and the<br />
story changes as you make those decisions.</p>
<p>Sometimes someone makes a decision to try something and you don’t know for<br />
sure how it would turn out; that’s when you roll dice to see what happens<br />
next. The higher you roll, the better the chance that things work out the way<br />
you want them to.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-do-we-do-it">So How Do We Do It?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-how-do-we-do-it" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Well, first you need to figure out what kind of story you’re going to tell.<br />
What genre are you interested in? Fantasy? Science fiction? Modern-day<br />
adventure? Will you play in the world of a TV show or comic book or movie that<br />
you love, or will you create your own world? For some great advice about how<br />
to design the framework of your game, see <a href="../../fate-
core/game-creation" title="Game Creation">Game Creation</a> in Fate Core.</p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose who will be the players, and who will be the<br />
gamemaster. Of the people around the table, all but one are referred to as<br />
players. Each player takes on the role of one player character or PC in the<br />
story, and puts themselves in their character’s shoes to make the decisions<br />
that their character would make. The remaining person is called the<br />
<a href="../../fate-accelerated/being-gamemaster" title="Being the
Gamemaster">gamemaster</a> or GM. The GM’s job is to present challenges to the players and<br />
to portray all the characters that aren’t controlled by the players (non-<br />
player characters or NPCs).</p>
<p>Once you decide who the GM will be, and what the genre and framework of the<br />
story will be, it’s time for the players to make their characters—that’s in<br />
the <a href="../../fate-accelerated/who-do-you-want-be" title="Who Do
You Want To Be?">next section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="telling-stories-together-what-do-you-mean">Telling Stories “Together”? What Do You Mean?<a class="headerlink" href="#telling-stories-together-what-do-you-mean" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>All the people at the table, GM and players alike, are responsible for telling<br />
the story. When you make a decision for your character (or for one of the<br />
NPCs, if you’re the GM), think about two things.</p>
<p>First, put yourself in your character’s shoes and think hard about what they<br />
would do—even if it’s not the best idea. If you’re playing a character that<br />
sometimes makes poor decisions, don’t be afraid to make a poor decision for<br />
them on purpose.</p>
<p>Second—and this is really important—think about the story that’s being told.<br />
Think about the choice that would make that story even better: more<br />
interesting, more exciting, funnier. Would a certain choice give another<br />
player’s character a chance to be awesome? Strongly consider making that<br />
choice.</p>
<p>That’s how you tell great stories together—by not being afraid for your<br />
character to make mistakes, and by making choices that make the story more<br />
interesting for everyone at the table—not just you.</p>
