<p>There’s one more thing you should ask yourself before you make an entirely new<br />
rule for something—can I represent this with the <a href="../..
/fate-core/extras#the-bronze-rule-aka-the-fate-fractal">Bronze Rule</a>?</p>
<p>In Fate, you can treat pretty much anything as if it were a character. Your<br />
gun? Sure. The storm outside? Absolutely. The scene itself? Why not? You can<br />
give anything aspects, skills, stunts, and stress boxes, and here’s the thing<br />
that makes this technique really cool—they don’t have to be the same ones the<br />
PCs get. It doesn’t make sense for the storm outside to have Fight and<br />
Physique, but what about Cold and Sleet? Your gun doesn’t need a physical or<br />
mental stress track, but what about an ammo stress track? And scenes already<br />
have aspects all over the place!</p>
<p>If you can represent a new thing as a character, it’s typically easier to do<br />
that than to create a new rule out of whole cloth. Not <em>everything</em> works this<br />
way, and there are some things you might not want to represent this way, but<br />
it’s a powerful tool that you can apply to a wide variety of situations.</p>
<p>There’s another extension of this technique—new rules for characters can be<br />
represented using the existing components of a character. You can represent<br />
magic through skills, super powers using aspects or stunts, and being<br />
corrupted by an ancient and seductive force with a stress track.</p>
