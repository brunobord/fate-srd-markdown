<p>The easiest thing to do in most cases is to simply tweak the skill list to<br />
reflect the needs of your specific game, and there are a few ways to approach<br />
that.</p>
<h2 id="adding-or-removing-skills">Adding or Removing Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-or-removing-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Is making stuff not an important part of your game? Get rid of Craft. Do you<br />
want people to be able to maneuver in zero-G? Add a skill to do that. This is<br />
one of the easiest ways to hack the skill list because all you’re doing is<br />
going skill by skill and deciding what isn’t necessary and what needs to be<br />
added.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind here. First, if you subtract too<br />
many skills then the players might have access to too much of the skill list.<br />
If there’s too much overlap between PCs, you can wind up with PCs getting too<br />
little spotlight time. Conversely, if you add too many skills you might wind<br />
up with PCs who don’t have access to _enough _of the skill list, meaning<br />
they’re often missing a critical skill in a given situation. An easy fix is<br />
appropriately increasing or decreasing the number of skills each PC gets<br />
during character creation.</p>
<p>Consider that Fate Core has 18 skills. As a rule of thumb, the pyramid allows<br />
a character to really stand out in 3 of them and have rankings in 7 more,<br />
leaving 8 unaccounted for. It’s not a precise ratio, but it’s worth keeping in<br />
mind when deciding if you need to change the pyramid. See <a href="../../fate-system-toolkit/structural-changes">Structural Changes<br />
</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that changes to skills have repercussions on stress<br />
tracks and turn order.</p>
<h2 id="reskinning-and-making-alterations">Reskinning and Making Alterations<a class="headerlink" href="#reskinning-and-making-alterations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If all of the default skills work for you from a mechanical perspective, but<br />
some of them don’t quite work with the themes of your game, change a few<br />
details. Lore might become Academia or Knowledge, Drive becomes Ride or Pilot,<br />
and so on. Doing this might also alter what a given skill can do. For example,<br />
if you reskin Lore to become Arcana and then determine that it’s the skill for<br />
spellcasting, suddenly it makes sense for you to be able to attack or defend<br />
with it.</p>
<h2 id="expansion-and-compression">Expansion and Compression<a class="headerlink" href="#expansion-and-compression" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>One handy trick for altering the skill list is to look at the skills in terms<br />
of their sphere of activity and how important they are to your game. If a<br />
particular sphere is less important, then you can compress the skills within<br />
that sphere into a single skill—in a non-violent game, you might compress<br />
Shoot and Fight into a single fight skill. On the other hand, if a particular<br />
sphere is very important, you might want to split that skill into finer<br />
gradients. If martial arts are important to your game, you might want to<br />
expand Fight into multiple skills, perhaps Armed, Hard Styles, and Soft<br />
Styles. The advantage of this approach is that the general guidelines for the<br />
skills are still in effect—you’re just adjusting the level of focus.</p>
