<p>Now that you’ve seen a wide array of examples, here’s your opportunity to make<br />
the game your own. This should be a simple process, but that’s never the whole<br />
story—it’s one of those things that seems complicated at first, but gets<br />
easier and easier each time you do it, until you get to the point where it’s<br />
so instinctive that it’s hard to grasp how it was ever a problem. Wherever you<br />
are on that arc, hopefully we’ve got something here to help you out.</p>
<h2 id="balance">Balance<a class="headerlink" href="#balance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>First, set aside your notions of balance. It’s an important concept, but not<br />
the way it’s usually used. Balance does not exist in the abstract—it is a<br />
specific element of play, and should always be looked at through the lens of<br />
play. Nothing is imbalanced on its own, it is only context that makes it so. A<br />
power that makes one character an omnipotent god might seem unbalanced, but<br />
when all the characters have it, that’s the foundation of a really neat game.<br />
It’s all about context.</p>
<p>If so, how do you balance your power designs? Think about three<br />
things—balancing them within the group, within the setting, and within play.</p>
<h3 id="group-balance">Group Balance<a class="headerlink" href="#group-balance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>When you design a power system, you need to make one of the following<br />
assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only some characters will use it.</li>
<li>Every character will use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are designing a power that only some characters will use, then you need<br />
to think about how that power compares to other things that characters can do<br />
and what characters are trading off to get that power. At its simplest, this<br />
means you must have a compelling answer to the question “Why _wouldn’t _I buy<br />
this power?”</p>
<p>Stormcallers is designed with this in mind. The reason you wouldn’t buy<br />
Stormcalling is because you’d need to sacrifice a skill slot—and an aspect—to<br />
buy in, and since Stormcalling is mostly combat-applicable, it’s a fairly<br />
equitable tradeoff. Even that carries the assumption that there are also<br />
things like weapon and armor rules in play. Without that assumption,<br />
Stormcalling is just a superior combat skill, and there’s no reason not to<br />
take it.</p>
<p>But notice that the trick of balancing that came from another part of the game<br />
itself. This is illustrative of something important about balance within the<br />
group—the purpose is to make sure that each player remains active and engaged.<br />
If you make one part of the game much cooler than the rest, then you should<br />
expect players to gravitate to it, and either support that or find other ways<br />
for them to be cool.</p>
<p>If you go the other way and assume that all your players will take a power,<br />
the sky’s the limit. You’ve diminished the risk of any one player<br />
overshadowing the others. <em>Six Viziers</em> is designed this way, and it<br />
illustrates the strengths and dangers of this approach. The abilities of the<br />
system are incredibly potent, and would be horribly spotlight-hogging in a<br />
game where only one character had them, but since everyone has similar<br />
potency, that’s not a danger. However, because the powers are so potent and<br />
diverse, care has to be taken that none of them dominate the game.</p>
<p>Nothing makes either approach better than the other—the logic of your power<br />
system will usually reveal whether it should be some-characters or all-<br />
characters. But that distinction needs to be clear to _you _when you design<br />
it. A system that tries to do both is one begging for abuse and inconsistent<br />
results.</p>
<h3 id="setting-balance">Setting Balance<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-balance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Setting balance may seem like a strange idea, but it’s critical to good power<br />
design, because power design <em>is</em> setting design. Your power rules are an<br />
assertion about how the world works, and you need to think them through as<br />
such. Questions you need to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who can use the power system?</li>
<li>How many users are there?</li>
<li>How proficient/potent are they?</li>
<li>How does the power impact the role of people who wield it?</li>
<li>What are common results of the power in the setting?</li>
<li>What are large-scale results of the power in the setting?</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, the more tightly you constrain the power, the less you need to<br />
worry about these things, but that runs the risk of the power feeling like an<br />
overlay on the setting rather than a true part of it. As a bonus, the more you<br />
think through the logical ramifications of the power, the better you will be<br />
able to balance it—in every sense of the word.</p>
<p><em>Voidcallers _is a great illustration of a magic system balanced against the<br />
setting. Note that there are very few mechanical checks on the use of magic in<br />
_Voidcallers</em>—it’s almost all setting elements, both in terms of the behavior<br />
of practitioners and the impact of powers. Anyone can use the power, so<br />
practitioners put up hurdles to keep others from using it, and in doing so,<br />
hide information about their numbers and proficiency. The impacts of the power<br />
are all pretty terrible, but are—so far—held in check by luck or good intent.<br />
Change that, and you change the power.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Want to shake up a game idea? Look at the answers to your setting balance questions and change one of them, and see what it does. For example, there’s no large-scale result of power in _Voidcallers _by default, but what if you change that? What if something ate Manhattan? Something so big and awful that it could not be covered up or hidden? What changes then?</p>
<h2 id="balance-in-play">Balance in Play<a class="headerlink" href="#balance-in-play" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is largely an extension of balance within the group, but it hinges on the<br />
question of how the powers drive play. Some games with powers are largely<br />
about the powers in question, such as supers games, or magi games in the<br />
tradition of Ars Magica. Other games, like classic adventuring or horror<br />
games, simply fold powers into the larger shape of play. Figure out which one<br />
your system does, and tune your powers appropriately.</p>
<p>On a more practical, mundane level, pay attention to how the actual _play _of<br />
your system works at the table. If the mechanics demand more of your<br />
attention—because they require more rolls, for example—then it’s a good chance<br />
that power is sucking attention away from non-powered players. This can be<br />
addressed through thoughtful GMing, but better if it’s not a problem in the<br />
first place.</p>
