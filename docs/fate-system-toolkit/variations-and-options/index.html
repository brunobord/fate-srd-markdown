<p>Perhaps each Storm also has a corresponding Calm—Blaze, Mountain, Sea,<br />
Snowfall, and Wind. Some who have mastered a Storm may in time gain another<br />
aspect—costing 1 refresh—to reflect that Calm, which will allow them to<br />
internalize the strengths of the Storm to enhance themselves in a variety of<br />
ways as well as generate more subtle effects.</p>

<p>Nothing prohibits a Caller from attuning to multiple Storms; it simply costs<br />
one refresh for each aspect he takes.</p>

<p>It is possible to have the Stormcaller skill but no attunement to a storm.<br />
This is the status of many hedge practitioners. The advantage to this is that<br />
they may work with whatever storm they wish. The downside is that it takes a<br />
few minutes to do what a true Stormcaller can do in a single exchange.</p>
<h2 id="summonings">Summonings<a class="headerlink" href="#summonings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Storms are not empty spaces. Beings native to each storm swim within them<br />
comfortably, and can be summoned to serve those who know how to call. See the<br />
<a href="../../fate-system-toolkit/storm-summoners">Storm Summoners</a> system<br />
for an exploration of this.</p>

<p>Those who study such things suggest that there is an arc to the great Storms.<br />
Born of almost pure energy (Thunder), they coalesce (Inferno) and thicken<br />
(Flood) before hardening (Glacier) into something concrete (Earthquake). Or<br />
perhaps it is the reverse, beginning with base matter and ascending toward<br />
energy. In either case, it is theorized that there exist a sixth and seventh<br />
“Storm,” bookending the great Storms. Energy and Light at one end, with Stasis<br />
and Darkness at the other. There have been those who have claimed to tap these<br />
forces in a fashion similar to the storms, but they are a rarity, and much of<br />
their effort has been spent in conflict with one another over the question of<br />
which is the beginning and which is the end.</p>
<h2 id="voidcallers">Voidcallers<a class="headerlink" href="#voidcallers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>For all their destructive fury, the Storms are part of reality, for they are<br />
both destruction and creation. On a cosmic level, they stand against the Void,<br />
the nothingness that seeks to consume all. Light- and Darkcallers tend to<br />
characterize their opposite in this manner, and there’s no telling what truth<br />
there is or isn’t to it. The Void is a force for destruction, and while it may<br />
not be malicious, those who dwell in it are, for it is the home to demons and<br />
monsters that would like nothing more than to consume the Storms, and with<br />
them, our world. See the <a href="../../fate-system-
toolkit/voidcallers">Voidcallers</a> section for more ideas on this.</p>
