<h1 id="vehicles">Vehicles<a class="headerlink" href="#vehicles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In a game that largely revolves around personal activity, vehicles occupy a<br />
strange space. They extend the character’s capabilities like tools or weapons,<br />
but they’re external to the character, in the manner of allies and resources.<br />
It’s a space that is easily overlooked, but which can be utterly essential,<br />
depending on the priorities of the player or campaign.</p>
<p>In describing vehicles, this section generally assumes cars and trucks, but<br />
many of these ideas are easily extrapolated to horses, chariots, spaceships<br />
and beyond.</p>
<h2 id="incidental-vehicles">Incidental Vehicles<a class="headerlink" href="#incidental-vehicles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In many games, vehicles are merely _incidental _to play. That is, they come up<br />
when the situation demands, but otherwise aren’t given a lot of thought. In<br />
this case, vehicles are frequently just an enabler for using the Drive skill.<br />
When the bad guys are getting away in a car, and you hop in a car to pursue,<br />
it’s all about the skills from there.</p>
<p>If there’s ever a need to differentiate vehicles in this context, it should<br />
most often take the form of aspects. A vehicle will usually have between one<br />
and three aspects, the specifics of which depend very much on your table’s<br />
interest in cars. Aspects like <span class="aspect">Big</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Fast</span>, <span class="aspect">Off-Road</span>, or<br />
<span class="aspect">Clunker</span> are totally valid, as are<br />
<span class="aspect">Hemi</span>, <span class="aspect">Canted Wheels</span> or [span:aspect<br />
]Five-Speed, Fuel-Injected</span>.</p>
<p>For most games this is enough, but in a game where driving is critical,<br />
there’s a good chance that vehicles may end up being more or less disposable.</p>
<h2 id="personal-vehicles">Personal Vehicles<a class="headerlink" href="#personal-vehicles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A personal vehicle is most likely to be represented by an aspect, but details<br />
beyond that depend a lot on your game. A more down-to-earth game may simply<br />
have a signature vehicle, like a detective’s sports car, but some games might<br />
be better suited to gadget-festooned supercars.</p>
<p>The basic rules for vehicles need be no more complicated than the incidental<br />
vehicles rules, and for more complicated vehicles, extras start becoming<br />
appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="repair">Repair<a class="headerlink" href="#repair" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>An item represented by an aspect cannot usually be destroyed, yet despite<br />
this, it can stretch credulity to have a vehicle prove entirely immune to<br />
damage. As a rule of thumb, allow a personal vehicle to be damaged normally,<br />
but say that the damage was repaired without difficulty between sessions.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, the player _wants _to work with the damage. Having a car in<br />
need of repair is a great scene frame and occasional motivator—perhaps it<br />
requires a particular part. If a player opts to treat the car as damaged, then<br />
the first time in a session they expressly touch on the necessary repairs—such<br />
as having a conversation while working on the engine—that is effectively a<br />
compel, and grants the player a FP.</p>
<h2 id="group-vehicles">Group Vehicles<a class="headerlink" href="#group-vehicles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>An idea that sees frequent use in fiction and gaming is that of a common<br />
vehicle, usually some sort of ship, van, car, or the like that serves as group<br />
transportation and often as a mobile base of operations.</p>
<p>An easy way to do this is to make the vehicle in question an aspect for<br />
everyone in the group—or at least everyone tied to the vehicle. Doing so makes<br />
a strong statement about the centrality of the vehicle to the game.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to take a more nuanced approach, and have each character<br />
take an aspect that reflects their relationship with the vehicle—a spaceship’s<br />
captain and her engineer may have very different perspectives on the nature of<br />
their ship.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, a group vehicle can have aspects like an incidental<br />
vehicle, but there’s a lot more leeway in terms of what exactly those aspects<br />
should be. Each player aspect related to the vehicle allows that player to<br />
assign an aspect to the vehicle. This allows for differing levels of<br />
investment built organically from player interest.</p>
<h2 id="quick-and-dirty-vehicle-rules">Quick and Dirty Vehicle Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-and-dirty-vehicle-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="vehicle-mismatches">Vehicle Mismatches<a class="headerlink" href="#vehicle-mismatches" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The quick and dirty hierarchy of speed goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foot</li>
<li>Bike/Horse</li>
<li>Car/Motorcycle</li>
<li>Helicopter</li>
<li>Airplane</li>
</ul>
<p>When a chase involves a speed mismatch, the faster driver gets a number of<br />
free invocations of vehicle aspects equal to the difference between the tiers.<br />
This can be mitigated by circumstances—feet and bikes can outpace a car in a<br />
traffic jam, and a car might help you catch up with a plane before it’s<br />
airborne—but it should be enough to cover edge cases.</p>
<h3 id="stealing-a-car">Stealing a Car<a class="headerlink" href="#stealing-a-car" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Attempting to steal or otherwise acquire a car should be treated as an<br />
overcome action, with the appropriate skill—usually either Burglary or<br />
Resources—against a difficulty based on the situation, taking into account<br />
both security level and range of options. Upon success, the aspects created<br />
are the aspects of the stolen vehicle. This assumes the character is just<br />
taking what they can get—trying to steal a specific car will be an overcome<br />
roll against the specifics of that situation.</p>
<h3 id="custom-cars">Custom Cars<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-cars" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Car customization is an application of the Crafts skill that requires a shop<br />
and appropriate tools. Baseline difficulty of the overcome roll is 0, +2 for<br />
each aspect on the vehicle. With a success, an aspect can be added to the<br />
vehicle, or if it’s feasible, removed. The maximum number of aspects a vehicle<br />
may have is 5.</p>
<h3 id="vehicle-damage">Vehicle Damage<a class="headerlink" href="#vehicle-damage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Vehicles don’t have stress, but _can _take consequences—usually to turn a<br />
failed Drive roll into a success using the <a href="../../fate-system-toolkit/consequences">Extra Effort optional rule<br />
</a>. An average vehicle—3 or<br />
fewer aspects—can take one mild consequence. An exceptional vehicle—4 or 5<br />
aspects—can take one mild and one moderate consequence. A vehicle with an<br />
aspect like <span class="aspect">Rugged </span>or <span class="aspect">Military Grade</span><br />
may be able to take one severe consequence.</p>
