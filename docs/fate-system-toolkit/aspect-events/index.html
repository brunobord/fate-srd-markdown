<p>This is a trick you can use to create the framework of an adventure—you can<br />
even combine this technique with the previous technique to inject events based<br />
on player input.</p>
<p>An aspect event has two components: the event list and the crescendo aspect.<br />
The <strong>event list</strong> is a series of things that will happen, leading up to the<br />
crescendo aspect. Think of the <strong>crescendo aspect</strong> as what will happen if the<br />
players don’t intercede. A good event has three to six aspects plus the<br />
crescendo aspect.</p>
<p>When the adventure starts, check off the first aspect and bring it into the<br />
story. This is the inciting incident, the thing that gets the PCs involved.<br />
It’s an aspect like any other—you and the players can compel it or invoke it<br />
as appropriate. It stays in play until it’s no longer relevant, at which point<br />
you simply cross it off.</p>
<p>Whenever the story suggests that things should move on, or whenever there’s a<br />
lull in the action, check off the next aspect and bring it into the story.<br />
It’s now an aspect that can be invoked or compelled, and it’s a new element to<br />
the story. Keep doing this for as long as you need to. Accelerate the rate at<br />
which you bring in aspects, if the players are getting distracted or not<br />
getting involved, or slow it down if they’re being really proactive.</p>
<p>If the crescendo aspect gets checked off, things have gotten really, really<br />
bad. This usually indicates that the bad guys are on the verge of winning, and<br />
that the players need to step up their game!</p>
<p>If you don’t check off all the aspects by the time the PCs wrap things up,<br />
that’s fine! It just means the PCs were on their game, and that they got to be<br />
awesome and win big. If you check off all the aspects and things go badly for<br />
the PCs, that’s also fine! You can snowball what happened in this story into<br />
the next one, and up the ante a bit.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="aspect">Explosions and Fire!</span></li>
<li><span class="aspect">A Rash of Murders</span></li>
<li><span class="aspect">Citywide Panic</span></li>
<li><span class="aspect">Under Terrorist Threat</span></li>
<li><span class="aspect">Three Hours to Detonation</span></li>
<li>
<p><span class="aspect">Smoking Crater</span></p>
