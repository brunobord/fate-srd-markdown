<p>By default, Fate abstracts weapons and armor—along with all gear—into flavor.<br />
Having a gun allows you to attack someone with Shoot, but doesn’t do anything<br />
more. If you want weapons and armor to matter more, <a href="../..
/fate-core/more-examples-extras#weapon-and-armor-ratings">Extras</a> in Fate Core<br />
presents rules for Weapon and Armor ratings. If <em>those</em> aren’t to your liking<br />
either, here are a few more alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="damage-floors-and-ceilings">Damage Floors and Ceilings<a class="headerlink" href="#damage-floors-and-ceilings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In Fate Core, weapons are <em>dangerous</em> if you use the rules in the Extras<br />
chapter. A relatively unskilled swordswoman who gets a lucky hit with a two-<br />
hander can cleave a man in twain without trying too hard, and that can be<br />
scary. It lends itself to a gritty, lethal game, and if that’s not your cup of<br />
tea, you might want weapon and armor ratings that provide less lethality but<br />
still matter.</p>
<p>When you use these rules, Weapon ratings still start at 1 and go up, but they<br />
can go up a bit further (say to 5 or 6, for the most lethal of weapons).<br />
Instead of simply adding a weapon’s rating to the shifts you generate on a<br />
hit, though, a Weapon rating provides a _minimum _number of shifts of stress<br />
you can score with that weapon. For example, a longsword with Weapon: 3 does 3<br />
shifts of stress if you tie, or if you roll 1, 2, or 3 shifts on your attack.<br />
Even for a grazing hit, you’ll still always deal at least 3 shifts of stress.<br />
If you roll shifts beyond that, you simply deal that much stress and ignore<br />
the Weapon rating.</p>
<p>Armor ratings do the opposite; they tell you what the <em>maximum</em> number of<br />
shifts of stress you’ll take from an attack is. Armor ratings start at 4 (for<br />
light armor) and go down to 1 (for the heaviest plate or most advanced powered<br />
tactical armor). The exception to this is when the attacker succeeds with<br />
style—if this happens, ignore the Armor rating. The attacker does <em>full<br />
damage</em> when she succeeds with style.</p>
<p><em>Armor ratings trump Weapon ratings</em>. This means that someone with Weapon 5<br />
attacking someone with Armor 3 will still only deal 3 stress at most, unless<br />
they succeed with style.</p>
<h2 id="armor-and-weapon-aspects">Armor and Weapon Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#armor-and-weapon-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../fate-system-toolkit/gear-aspects">Gear Aspects</a> we told you<br />
that you could model important gear as aspects. This works for most gear, but<br />
some people may still want a little more when it comes to weapons and armor.<br />
This rules mod is meant to be layered on top of that system, though there’s no<br />
reason you couldn’t use it on its own—it would just mean that <em>only</em> weapons<br />
and armor are aspects, and other gear isn’t.</p>
<p>Weapons are divided into <strong>light</strong>, <strong>standard</strong>, and <strong>heavy</strong>. A light<br />
weapon could be a small knife or truncheon, a standard weapon is something<br />
like a sword or pistol, and a heavy weapon might be a shotgun, sniper rifle,<br />
or massive two-handed sword.</p>
<p>When you successfully attack with a weapon, you may make a special invocation<br />
with it. It costs a fate point as usual, but provides neither a +2 nor a<br />
reroll. Instead, you can force your opponent to take a consequence instead of<br />
stress. With a light weapon, you may force someone to take a mild consequence.<br />
A standard weapon forces a moderate consequence, and a heavy weapon forces a<br />
severe consequence. If you succeed with style, move the consequence up by one<br />
level of severity—minor to moderate, moderate to severe, severe to either<br />
taken out or an extreme consequence (<del>victim’s</del> defender’s choice). If the<br />
appropriate consequence slot is already in use, move the new consequence up by<br />
one level of severity.</p>
<p>This special invocation also acts a little bit like a compel. When you invoke<br />
a weapon aspect in this way, you offer the fate point to your target. If he<br />
takes the fate point, you deal the consequence. He can _refuse _the fate point<br />
and pay you one of his own to not take the consequence, but then he takes the<br />
stress he would have taken normally anyway.</p>
<p>Armor aspects are similarly divided into light, medium, and heavy, and also<br />
allow for special invocations. You can invoke light armor to absorb a single<br />
mild consequence; you don’t take the stress it would have absorbed, and you<br />
don’t fill the consequence slot. Medium armor can absorb a moderate<br />
consequence. Heavy armor can absorb a severe consequence, or two mild or<br />
moderate consequences in any combination. You can use your armor to absorb<br />
consequences beyond these limits, but if you do so, the armor aspect<br />
immediately changes to represent the fact that it’s broken and no longer able<br />
to absorb attacks. You’ll have to get it repaired, which might cost you and<br />
might take anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on the armor and<br />
the place you take it.</p>
<h2 id="red-and-blue-dice">Red and Blue Dice<a class="headerlink" href="#red-and-blue-dice" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you have at least three colors of Fate dice and want something that isn’t<br />
quite so predictable for your weapons and armor, you can use Red and Blue dice<br />
in place of Weapon and Armor ratings. We’re using “Red” and “Blue” here for<br />
convenience—you can use any two colors of dice you want, as long as they don’t<br />
get used for anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Red is for weapons</strong>: The more Red your weapon has, the bigger and/or deadlier it is. A Red:1 weapon could be a dagger, a goblin’s claws, or a very low-caliber pistol, while a Red:4 weapon could be a greatsword, a dragon’s bite, or a close-range blast from a combat shotgun.</p>
<p>When you attack, for every point of Red your weapon has, replace one of your<br />
usual Fate dice with a Red Fate die. If your attack outcome is a tie or<br />
better, each of your Red dice that comes up <span class="fate_font">+</span> increases<br />
the hit by +1 shift of harm.</p>
<p><strong>Blue is for armor</strong>: The more Blue armor your armor has, the more protective it is. Light armor, like cured leather or tough hide, is Blue:1. Heavy armor, like a mail hauberk or plate armor, is Blue:2 or 3.</p>
<p>When you defend, for every point of Blue your armor has, replace one of your<br />
usual Fate dice with a Blue Fate die. If your defend outcome is a failure or a<br />
tie, each of your Blue dice that comes up a <span class="fate_font">+</span> absorbs 1<br />
shift of harm.</p>
<p>Because you’re always rolling four Fate dice, the maximum number of Red or<br />
Blue dice you can have on a roll is four.</p>
<p>To mix things up even more, you can give defensive weapons Blue, like a<br />
quarterstaff or main gauche, and “offensive” armor Red, like plate armor with<br />
big nasty spikes or an electrostatic force field. You could also have stunts<br />
that let you swap Blue dice for Red when you defend—for example, a fencing<br />
master with a killer riposte, or a magical flaming shield.</p>
