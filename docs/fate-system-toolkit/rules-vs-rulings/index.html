<p><strong>Sure, you <em>can</em> hack Fate, but should you?</strong> Sometimes the answer is yes. If you’re playing a supers game, you’ll need to add some super powers. If you’re playing a game about street racing, it might be good to have a few rules regarding vehicles.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don’t need a new rule, though. Sometimes all you need is a<br />
<em>ruling</em>.</p>
<p><strong>A ruling is a decision that your playgroup makes—usually guided by the GM—about how something works in your game.</strong> Rulings cover special cases that aren’t explicitly covered by the rules of the game, cases that require some interpretation. A new <em>rule</em>, on the other hand, is a change to one or more of the sub-systems within the game, or the addition of a new one. Where a ruling is an interpretation of how the game works, a new rule is a change to how the game works.</p>
<p>For example, when you tell a player that his character can’t take that long-<br />
range sniper shot because the boat he’s on is bobbing up and down too much,<br />
you’re making a ruling. When you explicitly state that <em>no one</em> can make long-<br />
range sniper shots from a boat, you’re adding a rule. See the difference? One<br />
affects the current situation and may have ramifications later on, the other<br />
affects all such situations.</p>
<p><strong>So when do you use one or the other?</strong> Use a new rule if you’re addressing something that comes up a lot. Whether you’re finding something problematic or you want to be able to do something new, if it happens a lot, it’s often a good case for a rule. Use a ruling if you’re not sure a situation will come up again, or if you think it’ll be rare.</p>
<p>If you make a new rule for every situation, you’ll wind up with so many rules<br />
that you can’t keep track of them all. If you make rulings for the edge cases,<br />
on the other hand, you’re freer to change them later. Sure, you can change a<br />
rule later, but some players will call foul on this—and rightly so! Worse, you<br />
make your rules even harder to remember and keep track of, especially if<br />
you’re changing them all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the secret—rulings can <em>become</em> rules.</strong> If you make a ruling about sniper shots on boats, and you find that situation comes up again and again, turn it into a rule. If you’ve made a ruling multiple times, your players will probably remember it, so there’s less chance of a rule that just gets forgotten.</p>
