<p>Sometimes the skill list as presented just won’t work for you. Maybe you want<br />
another list entirely, or maybe you’re looking for a different approach. The<br />
good news is that even if you do something drastically different, the<br />
guidelines of the existing skills can still be helpful to you, because the<br />
underlying _action _can still work the same way as the original skill. Whether<br />
the skill is called Fight, Kung Fu, or Existential Badass, the basic mechanics<br />
of punching someone are going to remain more or less the same.</p>
<h2 id="new-skill-lists">New Skill Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#new-skill-lists" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you’re looking to make another skill list in the same style as the existing<br />
one—simply with new skills—then the guidelines are going to depend a lot on<br />
why you’re making the change, and no one’s going to know that better than you.<br />
The guidelines for adding and removing skills are your best reference for<br />
this.</p>
<h2 id="professions">Professions<a class="headerlink" href="#professions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>While skills normally reflect _what _you do, professions reflect _who _the<br />
character is, and infer capabilities from that. If, for example, the<br />
professions are Fighter, Scholar, Woodsman, Thief, Craftsman and Diplomat,<br />
then you might roll Fighter in situations where you might roll Fight or Shoot,<br />
Thief where you might normally roll Stealth or Burglary, and so on. Profession<br />
lists tend to be shorter and more open ended than skill lists, which may mean<br />
a very reduced pyramid. It’s possible to use a fixed list of professions, or<br />
use them in in a freeform manner, which we’ll get into below.</p>
<h2 id="approaches">Approaches<a class="headerlink" href="#approaches" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If the normal skill list is what you do and professions reflect who you are,<br />
approaches reflect _how _you do things. That is, instead of more typical<br />
skills, a character may have a rating in Forceful, Graceful, Clever, and<br />
Resolute, and which he rolls depends upon the situation. In a swordfight, are<br />
you hammering at your opponent’s guard (Forceful!), swinging down from a<br />
chandelier (Graceful!), feinting and maneuvering as you seek an opening<br />
(Clever!) or biding your time until your opponent makes a mistake (Resolute!)?</p>
<p>Fans of Fate Accelerated Edition will recognize this method as the one FAE<br />
uses, with the approaches Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, and<br />
Sneaky.</p>
<h2 id="freeform-skills">Freeform Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#freeform-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>So, what if there were no skill list at all, and players were able to simply<br />
name their skills? It might seem a little bit chaotic at first, but most<br />
likely you’d see a lot of familiar patterns, with new and interesting names.<br />
Such an approach is absolutely playable, with only one real caveat—everyone<br />
needs to be on the same page regarding what skills mean. Otherwise it’s<br />
possible that one player may end up with a super-skill that’s useful in every<br />
situation, leaving the rest of the group out in the cold.</p>
<p>The easiest way to avoid this is make sure everyone understands the difference<br />
between a skill, a profession, and an approach. Most problems will emerge if<br />
you have one player choosing skills while another is choosing a profession or<br />
approach, because professions and approaches are much more broadly applicable<br />
than individual skills. Approaches and professions might be a little more<br />
interchangeable, but it is still something to tread carefully with.</p>
<p>In addition to opening up opportunities for player creativity, this approach<br />
allows for a particular trick—using aspects as skills.</p>
<h3 id="skills-and-aspects">Skills and Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#skills-and-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you’re using freeform skills, one of your skills could share a name with<br />
one of your aspects. If you’re a <span class="aspect">Knight of the Chalice</span> and<br />
also have Knight of the Chalice: Good (+3), there’s a certain sense of<br />
completeness to that. It’s far from mandatory, but sometimes it just feels<br />
like the right choice. It’s also possible to use aspects to forgo skills<br />
entirely, but that’s a bit more fiddly, and we’ll get to that further along.</p>
