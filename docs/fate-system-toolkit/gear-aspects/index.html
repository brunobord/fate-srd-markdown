<p>In Fate, gear is in the background. Your skills take center stage when it<br />
comes to what you can do; gear is simply there to enable you to use your<br />
skills. Do you have a high Shoot? Then you’ve got a gun! Did you prioritize<br />
Drive? You’ve probably got a car. These things are assumed, and have no<br />
mechanical effect. The Extras chapter in Fate Core tells you how you can give<br />
gear mechanical teeth, adding Weapon ratings or giving a piece of gear its own<br />
aspects or skills. There’s a middle ground, though, one that doesn’t require<br />
any reduction in refresh and that allows all significant gear to be<br />
significant.</p>
<p>If you want to tread that middle ground, keeping gear simple and in the<br />
background but increasing its mechanical weight, you can use <strong>gear aspects</strong>.<br />
In this method, most gear behaves like it does in default Fate—it enables<br />
skill use and provides justification for actions. However, if a piece of gear<br />
has the potential to be significant to the story at some point, it becomes an<br />
aspect.</p>
<p>A gear aspect can be as generic or as descriptive as you desire. If you’re the<br />
sort for whom guns are important but interchangeable, maybe you just have a<br />
<span class="aspect">Revolver</span> or a <span class="aspect">Sniper Rifle</span>. If you<br />
want to get a little more specific, maybe it’s a <span class="aspect">Pristine Colt<br />
.45</span> or a <span class="aspect">Silenced XM21</span>. Want to drill down even<br />
more? Give yourself <span class="aspect">My Father’s Service Revolver</span> or<br />
<span class="aspect">My Well-Used, Modified XM21</span>. The point is that, if it’s<br />
important, it gets an aspect. Things like your jacket and shoes, your<br />
sunglasses, your car keys—maybe even your car—don’t need aspects, _unless<br />
_they become important to the story.</p>
<p>A gear aspect functions like any other aspect: you can invoke it, and other<br />
people can compel it—or invoke it—against you. You can invoke a gear aspect<br />
any time it would be useful: invoke your <span class="aspect">25 Karat Watch</span><br />
when you want to flash a little bling and impress someone, or invoke your<br />
<span class="aspect">Press Pass</span> to get a little closer to that crime scene.</p>
<p>There’s one final rule when it comes to gear aspects, GMs—you can take them<br />
away. If a PC is starting to rely a little too much on a piece of gear, or if<br />
it just feels like time to shake things up, find a reason for that aspect to<br />
go away. Doing this is a compel, so the player <em>can _refuse it—and that’s<br />
fine—you don’t want to take away your players’ favorite parts of the game.<br />
Also, getting rid of the aspect doesn’t necessarily mean that the player loses<br />
that piece of gear permanently. A _Press Pass</em> can lose its aspect when the PC<br />
gets suspended, and a <em>Revolver</em> can be shut down when it runs out of ammo. In<br />
both cases, there’s a narrative way to get the aspect back, and sometimes that<br />
can kick-start an adventure on its own!</p>
<h3 id="too-many-aspects">TOO MANY ASPECTS?<a class="headerlink" href="#too-many-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If each PC has five aspects and maybe four or five gear aspects, plus there<br />
are scene aspects and consequences and what have you, isn’t that too many<br />
aspects? It sure can be! Here’s a secret: gear aspects are basically portable<br />
situation aspects. As such, they can do a lot of the heavy lifting that<br />
situation aspects can, if you feel like there’s too much going on in a scene.<br />
You don’t want to _eliminate _situation aspects altogether, but if each PC has<br />
a number of gear aspects, start with fewer situation aspects.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to limit the number of gear aspects each PC has. Not<br />
every piece of gear needs its own aspect, so limiting PCs to three, two, or<br />
even one signature piece of gear is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Finally, in a game focused on gear rather than PC relationships or previous<br />
adventures, gear aspects might replace the <a href="../../fate-core/phase-trio">“phase trio” aspects</a>.</p>
