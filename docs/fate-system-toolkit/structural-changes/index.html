<h1 id="structural-changes">Structural Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#structural-changes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>So far all of these systems still assume something that looks like the current<br />
skill list in most important ways—there’s a list arranged in a certain way,and<br />
a progressive set of bonuses. But those assumptions need not be universal—you<br />
can do some crazy stuff by stepping outside of the normal bounds.</p>
<h2 id="pyramid-alternatives">Pyramid Alternatives<a class="headerlink" href="#pyramid-alternatives" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The most obvious hack is to replace the <a href="../../fate-
core/skills">pyramid</a>, with a column system—as is used in advancement—with a point-buy<br />
system, or even something like skill packages from specific backgrounds. This<br />
is really something you can change quite freely, but before you do, just be<br />
sure you understand why the pyramid is in place. It is fast, it demands<br />
characters be capable (the apex) but well-rounded (the foundation), and it<br />
makes sure that not every character can do everything (the skills you can’t<br />
buy). It’s not unreasonable to change these—a superspy game, for example,<br />
might have characters with very broad skill bases—but make sure you know what<br />
problem you’re solving when you make the change.</p>
<h2 id="larger-steps">Larger Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#larger-steps" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Nothing says skills need to progress smoothly. Suppose that each “rank” of a<br />
skill was actually two steps on the ladder—you might now have a pyramid of 1<br />
Superb (+5), 2 Good (+3) and 3 or 4 Average (+1), and if you’re feeling mean,<br />
move the default down to Poor (-1).</p>
<p>Why do this? Suppose you have a small skill list, as you might for professions<br />
or approaches. You get a heroically potent pyramid—more so than the default,<br />
even—for a smaller list. It also strongly separates the “tiers” of skill<br />
level, something that may be thematically appropriate in certain genres.</p>
<h2 id="aspects-only">Aspects Only<a class="headerlink" href="#aspects-only" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you want to take a very extreme step, you can forgo skills entirely, and<br />
use aspects for everything. This requires a single change to the way aspects<br />
work. Now, in addition to everything else, they provide a passive +1 bonus in<br />
situations where they apply. Thus, if my aspects are<br />
<span class="aspect">Acrobatic</span>, <span class="aspect">Ladies’ Man</span>,<br />
<span class="aspect">Strong</span>, and <span class="aspect">Swordsman</span>, I can count on<br />
a +2—effectively a Fair skill—in most sword-fighting situations involving<br />
strength, which bumps to a Good (+3) if I do something acrobatic.</p>
<p>If taking this tack, some extra thought will need to go into aspect selection<br />
so that everyone has a good understanding of when their aspects are and aren’t<br />
applicable. The first instinct of many players will be to gun for broad,<br />
simple aspects, like strong or smart, because they’re so easy to apply in most<br />
situations. However, the real advantage will go to players who take the time<br />
to put a bit more story into their aspects. <span class="aspect">Knight</span> covers<br />
a lot of ground, but <span class="aspect">Knight of the Stars</span> covers even more,<br />
and <span class="aspect">Renegade Knight of the Stars</span> covers even more. As is<br />
so often the case, the most interesting characters will be the most<br />
mechanically potent.</p>
