<p>Skills already let you do a wide range of things, but they can be even more<br />
flexible than they initially appear. If you take a look at the skill list, you<br />
can see that every single skill has the overcome and create an advantage<br />
actions checked. This opens a lot of possibilities, even for skills that don’t<br />
seem to have a lot of interesting uses.</p>
<p>If a character has a high rank in a skill, Good (+3) or higher, this means<br />
that they are an expert in that particular area of endeavor. They possess deep<br />
knowledge within the narrow range covered by the skill. This knowledge covers<br />
the tools and trappings used by the skill and knowledge of other people who<br />
use the skill at the same high level.</p>
<p>The three attack skills—Fight, Shoot, and Provoke—are most often used in<br />
combat. That doesn’t mean combat is the only situation where these skills are<br />
useful. A character with the Shoot skill can identify ranged weapons, knows<br />
details about their care and maintenance, and knows where to obtain them. The<br />
same goes for Fight, regarding hand-to-hand weapons.</p>
<p>This opens up lots of possibilities for overcome or create an advantage<br />
actions. A Shoot expert could use their skill in an overcome action to find a<br />
gun seller in a new place, for example. Shoot could be used to create an<br />
advantage by identifying the type of gun by the sound of its shot and filling<br />
in details on the limitations of the model, or by noticing that an enemy’s<br />
weapon has not been properly cared for and could possibly malfunction.</p>
<p>Provoke might seem to be a harder skill to expand, but with Provoke, an expert<br />
could create an advantage to discover an opponent is bluffing, or to identify<br />
which person in a group of opponents is the biggest threat.</p>
<p>You can use other skills in a similar way. Burglary experts can find tools or<br />
other practitioners of the trade, or even identify the trademark techniques of<br />
other burglars they know by the traces they leave behind. Drive experts can<br />
identify vehicles and use create an advantage to talk about the subtle edges<br />
or disadvantages a particular make has when compared against another vehicle.</p>
<p>Skills that normally do not allow you to attack or defend—Burglary, Crafts,<br />
Investigate, Lore, and Resources—have lots of options for additional actions,<br />
and in the right circumstances might be used to attack or defend. In the right<br />
situation, Crafts could be used to create an attack through the construction<br />
of a dangerous trap, for instance. Burglary could be used for defense, if a<br />
character sets up countermeasures based on their detailed knowledge of<br />
security precautions. These should be very specific and very limited<br />
applications, but it can be quite rewarding to allow players to use these<br />
skills in a way that stretches their capabilities a bit.</p>
<p>Creativity is the order of the day. In almost any skill, a high level of<br />
ability opens up many possibilities. As a GM, it’s important to allow<br />
flexibility and logic to guide you, as your players are sure to surprise you.<br />
They should get the chance to feel exceptionally competent in their<br />
character’s area of expertise. When a player tries something new with a skill,<br />
consider the option carefully, and be open to a creative interpretation of the<br />
skill. As a player, let yourself try new things with your skills. If a<br />
situation arises where you think you would be able to use your skill in an<br />
unusual way, give it a shot! Fate is more interesting when the unexpected<br />
arises and players use an unexpected method to overcome the situation at hand.</p>
