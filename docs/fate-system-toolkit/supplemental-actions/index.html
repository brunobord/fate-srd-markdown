<p>Supplemental actions don’t appear anywhere in Fate Core, despite having<br />
appeared in previous versions of Fate. We did this for two reasons. First, we<br />
feel it’s better to use bonuses than penalties, and supplemental actions<br />
imposed a penalty. Second, supplemental actions are there to make things more<br />
“realistic,” but they don’t necessarily make things more fun or more like an<br />
exciting story. They make it harder to do cool things, not easier.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that the concept doesn’t have value, though. If you want to<br />
use supplemental actions, you can simply use them as they appear in previous<br />
versions of Fate—performing an action that would distract from your primary<br />
action imposes a -1 penalty on your primary action. Most of these actions are<br />
free actions in Fate Core. We leave it to you to determine which free actions<br />
should be supplemental actions.</p>
<p>If you want something that’s a little more in keeping with the ethos of Fate<br />
Core, and that doesn’t impose a penalty, try this out.</p>
<h3 id="supplemental-action">SUPPLEMENTAL ACTION<a class="headerlink" href="#supplemental-action" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>When you perform some minor action in addition to your primary action—moving a<br />
zone, drawing a weapon, ducking behind cover, or anything else that the GM<br />
deems is a supplemental action—you create a boost such as<br />
<span class="aspect">Distracted</span>, <span class="aspect">Obscured View</span>, or<br />
<span class="aspect">Shaky Aim</span>, which lasts until your next turn starts. You<br />
can perform only one such action, so you’ll create only one such boost. Anyone<br />
acting against you or defending against your action can use this boost—at<br />
which point it goes away, like a normal boost. Also, the GM may compel you<br />
with it once for free—meaning that she doesn’t have to offer you a fate point,<br />
but you may still pay one to resist the compel—at which point it disappears.</p>
