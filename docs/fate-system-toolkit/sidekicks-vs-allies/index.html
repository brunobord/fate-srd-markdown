<p>Players can select both sidekicks and allies as extras, but differentiating a<br />
boy wonder from a squad of professional agents can be tough. Here are a few<br />
ways to distinguish <strong>sidekicks</strong>, who work closely with the PCs, from trained<br />
<strong>allies </strong>that they may call upon in specific situations.</p>
<h2 id="permissions-and-costs">Permissions and Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#permissions-and-costs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>While both sidekicks and allies are extras (see <em><a href="../../fate-
core/extras">Extras</a></em> in Fate Core), sidekicks tend to be unlocked through personal<br />
relationships and allies tend to arise from organizational or resource-driven<br />
permissions. For example, Sherlock Holmes might select the aspect<br />
<span class="aspect">Good Friend of Dr. Watson</span> to add Watson to his sheet as a<br />
sidekick, while selecting the aspect <span class="aspect">Patron of the Baker Street<br />
Irregulars</span> would add the mostly nameless children he uses as spies and<br />
couriers. As for costs, sidekicks tend to impose social and relational costs<br />
on the characters—asking them to contribute to important causes or aid them in<br />
times of need—while allies usually require more direct payment, favors, or<br />
other resources.</p>
<h2 id="stress-tracks-and-consequences">Stress Tracks and Consequences<a class="headerlink" href="#stress-tracks-and-consequences" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>One great place to differentiate sidekicks and allies is with stress tracks<br />
and consequences in conflicts. Sidekicks are like supporting characters—give<br />
them a limited stress track with one mild (or perhaps moderate) consequence<br />
slot and one extreme consequence that might change the character’s sheet in a<br />
dramatic moment.</p>
<p>Allies, on the other hand, are usually faceless mobs that have a stress box<br />
for each member of the gang. Stress inflicted on allies typically knocks them<br />
out of the fight completely instead of leaving them with consequences that<br />
carry from scene to scene. This distinction makes it harder to take out a gang<br />
of allies in a single attack, but makes sidekicks more flexible and resilient<br />
across a variety of social and physical situations in which they can utilize<br />
their consequence slots to protect or defend the PCs.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-vs-temporary-allies">Permanent vs. Temporary Allies<a class="headerlink" href="#permanent-vs-temporary-allies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Sidekicks are almost always permanent parts of a character’s sheet, but allies<br />
might be temporary, depending on the needs of the PC. For example, an<br />
intelligence officer might take the aspect <span class="aspect">Sent by the<br />
Feds</span> to have a set of Federal Agents on call, at the cost of a point of<br />
refresh. It’s equally feasible that such a character could forgo such<br />
permanent allies in favor of creating an advantage for an upcoming scene,<br />
using Contacts or Resources. Of course, permanent allies should be much more<br />
powerful, with more stress boxes, additional aspects, and additional stunts,<br />
than temporary allies who are little better than a weak nameless mob.</p>
