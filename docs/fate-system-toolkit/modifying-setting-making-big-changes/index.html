<p>While Fate characters are always protagonists, sometimes the players decide<br />
they want to modify the setting itself, cleaning up the mean streets of a<br />
crime-ridden town or securing a military fortification against future attacks.</p>
<h2 id="discover-the-problems-before-you-solve-them">Discover the Problems Before You Solve Them<a class="headerlink" href="#discover-the-problems-before-you-solve-them" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>First, the players must gather the information they need to do the job.<br />
Perhaps the characters need to collect their existing experience—“Isn’t<br />
Bastion the main drug runner in town?”—or maybe they need to make new<br />
Contacts, Investigate, or Lore rolls to uncover old alliances and lost<br />
knowledge. Either way, the group should construct a series of <strong>setting<br />
aspects</strong> that represent the existing problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To clean up the streets, a group might list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="aspect">Local Drug Pushers</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="aspect">Midlevel Drug Mules</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="aspect">Drug Financiers</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="aspect">Corrupt Cops</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="aspect">Crime Kingpin, Marty O’Banner</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="episode-by-episode">Episode by Episode<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-by-episode" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>For each setting aspect the group wants to reform, the group must roll against<br />
an appropriate difficulty for resolving that problem. For example, arresting<br />
all the <span class="aspect">Local Drug Pushers</span> might require the characters to<br />
make a Resources roll to mobilize the existing police officers, or a Physique<br />
roll to actually capture the bad guys themselves. While the characters can<br />
invoke their own aspects, the GM can pay fate points to invoke the existing<br />
setting aspects—such as <span class="aspect">Corrupt Cops</span>—complicating the<br />
players’ progress.</p>
<p>For each roll, use the outcome to drop the characters into the middle of a<br />
situation—like a TV episode—that reflects the results of the roll. On a losing<br />
roll, the <span class="aspect">Local Drug Pushers</span> have gone to ground, and it’s<br />
going to take some digging to get them out. On a successful roll, the group<br />
has rounded up the bad guys, but needs to get them to start talking. Either<br />
way, if the characters manage to resolve the situation, flip the setting<br />
aspect to a positive, turning <span class="aspect">Local Drug Pushers</span> into<br />
<span class="aspect">A Few Clean Streets</span>.</p>
<p>Once they start to make progress, let the group freely invoke previously<br />
resolved setting aspects that apply, as the job might get easier when they<br />
work their way up the chain.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-a-montage">We Need a Montage!<a class="headerlink" href="#we-need-a-montage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you’re less interested in playing out the day-to-day changes needed to<br />
reform a criminal justice system or fortify a castle, you can instead<br />
construct montages for your characters’ progress. Set a time limit—including a<br />
limited number of actions—that represent that time and resources the<br />
characters have available to resolve the situation before the story picks up<br />
in full.</p>
<p>For each roll, the characters attempt to resolve one of the discovered aspects<br />
using appropriate skills. Characters can work together, or they can split up<br />
to try to solve multiple problems. In this style of making big changes,<br />
narrate the group’s success like a movie montage, pausing only long enough at<br />
each roll to see the group succeed or fail to improve the situation.</p>
