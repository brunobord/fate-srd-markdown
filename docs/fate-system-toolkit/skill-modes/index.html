<h1 id="skill-modes">Skill Modes<a class="headerlink" href="#skill-modes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>skill mode</strong> is a bundle of several skills that represents a broad area of<br />
competence. Modes are great for speeding up character creation even more than<br />
Fate Core already does. Instead of picking and rating 10 individual skills,<br />
players pick and rate three modes, and the skills come along for the ride.</p>
<p>Take a look at your game’s skill list and think about archetypes you’d like to<br />
see in your setting. For each of these archetypes, choose five or six relevant<br />
skills. Each of these skill groups is a mode. It’s okay if some skills show up<br />
in more than one mode, but if any are so common that they’re in nearly every<br />
mode, be aware that it’s going to lead to a certain sameness between<br />
characters.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want between four and eight modes—enough for variety, but few<br />
enough that picking three is still fast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ben is planning a classic fantasy game of dungeon-delving, treasure-<br />
grabbing, and the occasional dragon-slaying. This game’s skills are Athletics,<br />
Burglary, Contacts, Deceit, Empathy, Intimidation, Melee, Missile, Physique,<br />
Rapport, Stealth, Survival, and Will. Based on that list, he comes up with<br />
four modes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Battle</th>
<th>Talk</th>
<th>Thievery</th>
<th>Woodcraft</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Athletics</td>
<td>Contacts</td>
<td>Athletics</td>
<td>Athletics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intimidation</td>
<td>Deceit</td>
<td>Burglary</td>
<td>Lore</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Melee</td>
<td>Empathy</td>
<td>Deceit</td>
<td>Notice</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Missile</td>
<td>Rapport</td>
<td>Notice</td>
<td>Stealth</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Physique</td>
<td>Will</td>
<td>Stealth</td>
<td>Survival</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Ben notices that Athletics shows up in three of the four, but it’s such a<br />
broadly applicable skill that he can’t imagine any of those modes doing<br />
without it, either. Besides, the tomb-robber PCs are going to need it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ratings">Ratings<a class="headerlink" href="#ratings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The usual Fate Core skill pyramid doesn’t apply to skills in modes. Instead,<br />
each player picks three modes and rates them—one at Good (+3), one at Fair<br />
(+2), and one at Average (+1)—and the mode’s rating becomes the default rating<br />
for all of its skills. Skills at this rating are <strong>trained</strong>. Skills one step<br />
above their mode’s level are <strong>focused</strong>, and skills two steps above are<br />
<strong>specialized</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of Ben’s players, Will, wants to play a thief-type, so he picks Good<br />
(+3) Thievery. This means Athletics, Burglary, Deceit, Notice, and Stealth all<br />
start out trained, with a rating of Good (+3).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reinforced-skills">Reinforced Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#reinforced-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If two or three of a character’s modes contain the same skill, it’s<br />
<strong>reinforced</strong>. When this happens, write it down under its highest-rated mode,<br />
but not under any other. No skill should appear more than once on a character<br />
sheet.</p>
<p>If a skill is reinforced once—meaning it’s shared by two modes—improve it from<br />
trained to focused. If it’s reinforced twice—shared by all three modes—improve<br />
it from trained to specialized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to his Good (+3) Thievery, Will’s also picked Fair (+2) Talk and<br />
Average (+1) Battle. Both Battle and Thievery have Athletics, so it goes from<br />
trained to focused—from Good (+3) to Great (+4) under Thievery. Likewise, Talk<br />
and Thievery share Deceit, so that skill’s also focused under Thievery. So<br />
far, Will’s modes look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Good (+3)Thievery</th>
<th>Fair (+2) Talk</th>
<th>Average (+1) Battle</th>
<th></th>

<tr>
<td>+5</td>

<td>Intimidation, Melee, Missile, Physique</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="improving-skills">Improving Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>After that, each player has 7 points to further improve skills.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Improvement</th>
<th>Cost</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Focus a trained skill</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Specialize a focused skill</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Specialize a trained skill</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>No skill can ever be improved beyond specialized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will wants to be especially sneaky, so he spends 3 points to specialize<br />
Stealth, from Good (+3) to Superb (+5). He’d also like to be capable in<br />
combat, so he spends another 3 to specialize Melee as well, from Average (+1)<br />
to Good (+3). With his last point, he focuses Contacts, from Fair (+2) to Good<br />
(+3), so he can be a little better connected.</p>

<h2 id="modes-with-extras">Modes with Extras<a class="headerlink" href="#modes-with-extras" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Some modes offer access to <strong>extras</strong>—either because it contains a skill<br />
extra, or because it unlocks an aspect extra. For each such extra associated<br />
with a mode, the mode has one fewer skill than normal. For example, if<br />
standard modes in your game have five skills, a mode with a skill extra would<br />
have only four. Aspect extras are in addition to the usual number of aspects<br />
for your game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ben adds four modes to his list: Arcana and The Gods, for two different<br />
kinds of magic, and Dwarf and Elf, for…dwarves and elves. The first two have<br />
two extras each—a skill and an aspect, both related to magic—and the second<br />
two only have one—an aspect.</p>
