<p>In any adventure story, you’re going to have a big chase scene eventually.<br />
This is an adventure trope and Fate Core is aimed at the adventure genre. What<br />
you want is to make a chase exciting. It’s no fun—and it drains out a lot of<br />
the drama—to have a single roll determine who escapes. There are a couple of<br />
different ways to approach this type of action.</p>
<p>Using just the standard rules, you can simulate a chase as a <a href="../../fate-core/challenges">challenge<br />
</a>. For a basic chase that you don’t want<br />
to spend a lot of time resolving, this is perfectly adequate. Set some<br />
obstacles for the rolls the players need to make and let them resolve those<br />
obstacles. If they succeed in enough rolls, they either escape or, if they are<br />
pursuing, catch their quarry. Simple, but not too interesting.</p>
<p>If there is more active opposition, the <a href="../../fate-
core/contests">contest rules</a> are the next option and can work quite well. There is a bit of<br />
tension here, and the way to set this up so that every player character<br />
doesn’t need to make rolls individually is to frame the contest as occurring<br />
between two teams. The first team to achieve their three victories wins. If<br />
it’s the fleeing group, they get away, and if it’s the chasing group, they<br />
catch up, bringing whatever consequences that implies. Getting caught often<br />
triggers a conflict.</p>
<p>The contest rules work fine, but three victories is often pretty easy to<br />
achieve if you’ve got a reasonably sized group of characters, and sometimes<br />
you want some more drama in your chase scene. Here’s an alternative method,<br />
called the chase track. It’s a hybrid of the contest and conflict rules.</p>
<p>To start, set up a stress track for the chase. This is your timer for the<br />
scene. The fleeing party is trying to empty the stress track, while the<br />
pursuers are trying to fill it. The length of the stress track determines how<br />
long the scene lasts, and where you start on the track sets the difficulty of<br />
the escape.</p>
<p>You first need to decide how long you want your chase scene to go on. If you<br />
are looking for an average-length scene, a stress track of 10 should be the<br />
baseline. If you want to go less than 10, you should probably make the chase a<br />
regular contest. If you want the chase to be longer or more involved, add more<br />
stress. A 14-stress chase scene is a major event in the session, and an 18 or<br />
20 stress scene could be the main focus of a whole session of play. You<br />
probably don’t want to go longer than that, or you risk your chase scene<br />
stretching out so far that your players get bored.</p>
<p>Setting how many stress boxes are already checked off determines how close the<br />
pursuers are to catching the fleeing group. Usually you are going to want the<br />
stress to start right in the middle (5 on a 10-stress track). You can make it<br />
harder for the fleeing party to escape by setting the stress closer to the top<br />
of the range, like 7 stress on a 10-stress track. By the same token, you can<br />
make the escape easier by setting the starting stress at a lower level. It’s<br />
probably best to avoid this, unless the player characters are the pursuing<br />
party. If the chase is less complicated, just use a challenge or contest<br />
instead of the chase stress track.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got your stress track set, determine who gets to go first. This<br />
can be a judgment call, or it can be based on which individual character on<br />
each side has the highest relevant skill. Each side will take turns, so who<br />
starts has a slight advantage, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>In turn, each side makes skill rolls to attempt to increase or diminish the<br />
stress track. This is an overcome action, and it can be opposed by either a<br />
passive defense or, more likely, by an active opposition from the other side<br />
in the chase. These actions can be all sorts of things, and it’s most exciting<br />
if they are varied and inventive. Drive rolls for vehicular chases should<br />
describe how the character is dodging through barriers or oncoming traffic,<br />
for example, and Athletics for foot chases would be about how the characters<br />
climb up on to the rooftops and parkour across dangerous hazards. A variety of<br />
other skills can come into play for different sorts of actions. You can use<br />
Deceive to fake out your opponent, Fight to knock someone down, Notice to spot<br />
hazards and avoid them while allowing your opponent to get entangled, Physique<br />
to knock obstacles into your opponent’s way. If a player comes up with a good<br />
action for just about any skill, you should allow it.</p>
<p>When making your roll, the outcome determines what happens to the chase stress<br />
track.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you fail, your opponent has the choice to either create a boost that works against you, or to move the stress track one check in their direction.</li>
<li>If you tie, you may choose to move the stress track one check in your direction, but if you do so, your opponent gains a +1 on their next roll.</li>
<li>If you succeed, you move the stress track one check in your direction.</li>
<li>If you succeed with style, you get to move the stress track two checks in your direction, or one check and you gain a boost that you can use against your opponent on your next roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each side takes turns making moves and rolling against their skills. Make sure<br />
each of the player characters gets a chance to contribute to the escape<br />
attempt. Sometimes the rolls will go really well or really poorly and you<br />
won’t get to everyone, but that’s okay. Keep the tension up with good<br />
descriptions, going into detail about each move and its results. When one side<br />
or the other has either eliminated or filled the stress track, the chase is<br />
over. Someone has either been caught or escaped.</p>
