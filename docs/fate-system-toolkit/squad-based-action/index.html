<p>What if you want to play a squad of characters who are conscripted to storm<br />
the beaches at Normandy on D-Day? Can you use Fate to play a squad of space<br />
marines?</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Yes, you can.</p>
<p>These rules, like everything in Fate, are flexible enough to work with a<br />
variety of skins, accommodating modern military units, World War II squads,<br />
high fantasy armies, and futuristic bug-hunting mechs.</p>
<h2 id="creating-squads">Creating Squads<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-squads" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>First, create characters normally (see Fate Core, page 30). While you’re<br />
writing up your characters, name your squad and describe the role it plays in<br />
the greater force. Is it a ragtag bunch of ex-felon soldiers? Or a highly<br />
trained force of well-equipped professionals?</p>
<p>Whatever you decide, turn the description into two aspects, a <strong>squad<br />
concept</strong> for your squad, and a <strong>squad trouble</strong> that always seems to plague<br />
your unit. Any player in the unit can invoke these aspects and be compelled by<br />
them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lara, Antonio, and Michelle decide that their squad is a bootstrapped group<br />
of survivors who are fighting back after alien forces nearly destroyed New<br />
Orleans. After creating individual characters, they name their squad the Ninth<br />
Ward Defenders, giving it the squad concept <span class="aspect">Dogs of War</span> to<br />
represent their scrappy resilience and the squad trouble <span class="aspect">In Over<br />
Our Head</span> to show that the aliens are dominant.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="squad-skills">Squad Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#squad-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Unlike individual skills, squad skills can be used to reshape the whole<br />
battlefield. For example, your soldier might lead a charge against the enemy’s<br />
line or call in reinforcements to soften hardened defenses.</p>
<p>After creating the unit aspects, give your unit:</p>
<ul>
<li>One Fair (+2) squad skill</li>
<li>Two Average (+1) squad skills</li>
<li>One Squad Stunt</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to emphasize the squad over the individual characters, reduce your<br />
characters’ starting stunts and refreshes from three to two, and cap your<br />
skills at Good (+3) instead of Great (+4).</p>
<h2 id="operations">Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#operations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Operations skill measures your unit’s ability to work together on the<br />
battlefield, eliminating enemy units and securing key strategic positions.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span> <strong>Overcome</strong>: Operations allows you to overcome<br />
obstacles as a unit, such as when you lay down cover fire to reach a wounded<br />
soldier safely or work together to climb over a wall.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span> <strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: When you create an advantage<br />
with Operations, your unit is setting traps (<span class="aspect">Ambush!</span>) or<br />
charging directly at the barricades (<span class="aspect">Panicked Grunts</span>).</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span> <strong>Attack</strong>: Operations allows your squad to launch<br />
coordinated attacks against targets and should be rolled instead of an<br />
individual character’s Fight or Shoot whenever the squad acts as a unit.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span> <strong>Defend</strong>: Operations is rolled for defense when<br />
your unit attempts to retreat from the larger combat zone or otherwise avoid<br />
an enemy attack as a group.</p>
<h3 id="operations-sample-stunts">Operations Sample Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#operations-sample-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>Hard to Pin Down</strong>: Take a +2 on any Overcome roll made to retreat from a combat zone.</p>
<p><strong>Blitzkrieg</strong>: Your squad is fast, light, and deadly. Take +2 on all Operation rolls in which your attack focuses on catching the enemy off-guard.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Equipment skill represents the resources your squad has available to<br />
pursue its objectives.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span> <strong>Overcome</strong>: Like the Resources skill, Equipment can<br />
be used to get the squad through a situation that requires some additional<br />
gear. The squad might call in some trucks to carry them over rough terrain or<br />
even call in a bombing run.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span> <strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: Your squad might use<br />
Equipment to get some high-powered weaponry for a particular mission<br />
(<span class="aspect">Flamethrowers!</span>) or to procure resources that are crucial<br />
for navigation (<span class="aspect">Topographical Maps</span>).</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span> <span class="fate_font">D</span> <strong>Attack / Defend</strong>:<br />
Equipment isn’t used to attack or defend.</p>
<h3 id="equipment-sample-stunts">Equipment Sample Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment-sample-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>Hi-Tech Gear</strong>: You can use Equipment instead of Operations in any situation where raw technological superiority would win the day.</p>
<p><strong>Well-Stocked</strong>: You gain a +2 on all Equipment rolls made to create an advantage when you are accessing your preexisting supplies.</p>
<h2 id="recon">Recon<a class="headerlink" href="#recon" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span> <strong>Overcome</strong>: Recon isn’t used often to overcome<br />
obstacles, but it can be used, like Notice, to give the squad a chance to head<br />
off ambushes or traps.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span> <strong>Create Advantage</strong>: Your squad can use Recon during<br />
a battle to pierce the fog of war, gathering information beyond your immediate<br />
location.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span> <span class="fate_font">D</span> <strong>Attack / Defend</strong>: Recon<br />
isn’t used to attack or defend.</p>
<h3 id="recon-sample-stunts">Recon Sample Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#recon-sample-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>Codebreakers</strong>: On a successful Recon roll to create an advantage while monitoring enemy communications, you can discover or create one additional aspect (though this doesn’t give you an extra free invocation).</p>
<p><strong>Counterprogramming</strong>: You can use Recon instead of Operations to set a trap when you use the enemy’s communications system against them.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-squad-skills">Rolling Squad Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#rolling-squad-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In order to make a squad skill roll or use a squad stunt, one player must<br />
decide to give up his personal action to rally the group. The nature of<br />
rallying will depend on the situation—military units typically follow<br />
orders—but generally the player will need the support of most of the other<br />
player characters.</p>
<p>If he’s successful in directing the squad, the difficulty of the task drops by<br />
1 for each additional squadmate who sacrifices their next action to the new<br />
goal, as the group turns all its attention to accomplishing the goal. In<br />
addition to reducing the difficulty, the success or failure of the roll is<br />
carried across the whole unit, as the squad’s skills have the potential to<br />
reshape the battlefield and win the day—or cause the squad to suffer together.<br />
As such, stress inflicted on the squad as a whole is inflicted on each<br />
squadmate equally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than make a roll to try to breach an alien barrier by herself, Lara<br />
decides to rally the Ninth Ward Defenders to knock it down together. The<br />
difficulty of accomplishing the task falls from Fantastic (+6) to Great (+4).<br />
If she succeeds, the whole unit will get the benefit of breaching the enemy<br />
barrier without having to roll a second time. If she fails, the whole unit<br />
will suffer stress from the alien counterattack.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="squad-based-combat">Squad-Based Combat<a class="headerlink" href="#squad-based-combat" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To run a great squad combat, use Operations rolls to move directly to the<br />
heart of the action. Rather than start at the beginning of the fight—when the<br />
conflicts are boring—get the squad to develop a plan of attack and roll<br />
Operations as an Overcome with a difficulty appropriate to the target to see<br />
how things turn out.</p>
<p>If they are successful, the players should narrate one good outcome for every<br />
shift above the target. If they fail, the GM will narrate one negative outcome<br />
for every shift below the target. Either way, jump straight to the exciting<br />
action. Repeat when things start to drag in the middle of the fight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After breaching the alien barrier, Lara is pretty sure that her PC can get<br />
close enough to the alien queen to kill her before the rest of the aliens<br />
regroup. She rallies the Ninth Ward Defenders to charge the enemy line,<br />
rolling their Fair (+2) Operations against a difficulty of Great (+4) set by<br />
her GM. She gets a +2 on her roll, but invokes the <span class="aspect">Dogs of<br />
War</span> to get another +2 for a total of Fantastic (+6). For her first<br />
shift, she narrates that they charge the line successfully, and for her<br />
second, she states that her character gets close enough to kill the queen.</p>
