<h1 id="zones">Zones<a class="headerlink" href="#zones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Using zone maps during conflicts breaks up the physical space of a fight,<br />
giving characters with high Athletics and Physique scores the opportunity to<br />
dominate the battlefield. Here are a few ideas to make zones an exciting part<br />
of your game:</p>
<h2 id="moving-through-zones">Moving Through Zones<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-through-zones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In games with quite a few zones, you may want to allow characters to sacrifice<br />
their turn in order to move a number of zones equal to their Athletics or to<br />
remove a number of physical obstacles equal to their Physique. Fast and strong<br />
characters want to be fast and strong, but rolling dice isn’t always the best<br />
way to represent that in Fate.</p>
<h2 id="tight-zones-can-create-drama">Tight Zones Can Create Drama<a class="headerlink" href="#tight-zones-can-create-drama" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>While zones divide up big areas like parking lots and stadiums—showing how<br />
difficult it is to run across a football field quickly—they can also be used<br />
to divide up small areas in interesting ways. For example, a fight on a ship<br />
might take place in tight quarters that require allies to cross several zones<br />
in order to offer support to a friend in trouble. By forcing players to choose<br />
between spending actions on moving or offering help from afar, zones can make<br />
ordinary conflicts dramatic.</p>
<h2 id="dangerous-zone-aspects">Dangerous Zone Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#dangerous-zone-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Zones can also create drama by restricting movement and providing threats the<br />
characters have to overcome. For example, a zone on a battlefield might have<br />
the aspect <span class="aspect">Taking Heavy Fire</span>, requiring characters to make<br />
an Athletics roll to avoid taking damage as they run through the firefight.<br />
Some zones might also disappear after a specified number of turns. Collapsing<br />
bridges, sinking ships, and closing doors all push characters to move quickly<br />
as the battlefield shifts around them and give the players a chance to force<br />
NPCs into those zones to contend with the threats as well.</p>
<h2 id="mental-or-social-zones">Mental or Social Zones<a class="headerlink" href="#mental-or-social-zones" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Not all conflicts happen in the physical world; Fate characters are often<br />
drawn into social or mental conflicts that can be mapped out in interesting<br />
ways. For example, a psychic surgeon may find her way through a patient’s<br />
dreamscape blocked by situation aspects that must be overcome though a series<br />
of Investigation and Empathy rolls. The zones could detail the obstacles that<br />
are keeping the patient from accessing old memories, traces of trauma and<br />
abuse that the PCs must punch through before they help the patient overcome<br />
his or her past. Similarly, a GM might detail several different social groups<br />
in a high school, indicating which groups the PCs have to impress before they<br />
can gain access to the more popular students. In essence, these mental and<br />
social zones serve to constrain the players, directing them toward conflicts<br />
by limiting their movement.</p>
