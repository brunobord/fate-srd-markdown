<h1 id="power-level">Power Level<a class="headerlink" href="#power-level" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Fate Core provides a default power level that emulates a specific kind of<br />
action. It’s heroic and action-oriented, but it’s also a bit gritty, with<br />
heroes that are fragile enough to get hurt badly after a few good hits but<br />
tough enough to stay alive for a while. It also provides a certain level of<br />
competence in the form of the skill levels and fate points you get.</p>
<p>That power level isn’t right for every game, though. Sometimes you want to<br />
emulate high-octane pulp or gritty noir, and the default settings for those<br />
dials aren’t quite right. Well, no problem—just adjust those dials!</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In Fate Core, characters have ten skills in a pyramid ranging from Average<br />
(+1) to Great (+4). This emulates highly competent individuals with a small<br />
number of things that they’re very good at and a wider variety of things that<br />
they’re pretty good at. There are two things you can adjust when it comes to<br />
skills: number of skills and skill cap.</p>
<p>When you increase the number of skills available, you’re making the characters<br />
competent at a wider variety of things. When you increase the skill cap, you<br />
allow PCs to become very good at a few things, possibly reaching into<br />
superhuman levels. Decreasing these things tends to push things into a<br />
grittier area; fewer skills means the heroes have more niche protection but<br />
also increases the chance that the group won’t have a specific, important<br />
skill. Decreasing the skill cap makes the PCs less competent, which can be<br />
good if you’re trying to emulate a group full of regular folks.</p>
<p>Most games increase or decrease both; adjusting one without adjusting the<br />
other can result in skill bloat or the upper limits of capability going<br />
unused.</p>
<h2 id="refresh">Refresh<a class="headerlink" href="#refresh" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Adjusting refresh up or down impacts PC competency and versatility directly.<br />
More importantly, it also affects how often the PCs have to accept compels.<br />
Higher refresh means the PCs get more fate points every session, which means<br />
they can refuse more compels. Lower refresh means compels are more important,<br />
but it also means the players are more at the GM’s mercy.</p>
<p>Refresh also affects how many extra stunts a player can buy, which has a<br />
direct impact on specialization, niche protection, and competency.</p>
<h2 id="stunts">Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>It should come as no surprise that handing out more free stunts makes PCs more<br />
powerful, and handing out fewer makes them less so. This will also have an<br />
impact on refresh—fewer free stunts means players might need to spend some of<br />
their precious refresh on more stunts, and vice versa.</p>
<p>A second way to adjust power level through stunts without affecting the number<br />
of stunts a PC gets is to adjust the power level of the stunts themselves. In<br />
Fate Core, a stunt is worth about 2 shifts. Adjusting that up to 3 or 4 means<br />
that each stunt has more individual impact, while adjusting it downward makes<br />
each less important.</p>
<h2 id="stress">Stress<a class="headerlink" href="#stress" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Fate Core sets stress tracks at 2 each, adjusting them upward based on certain<br />
skills. You can increase this to make characters tougher if you want them to<br />
be able to take more of a beating, while adjusting stress downward makes them<br />
more fragile. This change has a direct impact on how long fights last. More<br />
stress means PCs can shrug off more punishment, which makes fights less risky<br />
and probably more common. Lower stress means fights are a lot more dangerous,<br />
which means that players will think twice before starting one. It also means<br />
they’ll need to consider conceding more often in order to avoid getting taken<br />
out.</p>
<h2 id="aspects">Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Adjusting the number of aspects upward or downward from five doesn’t have as<br />
much effect on power level as some of the other dials you can turn, but it<br />
does have an impact on character versatility. More aspects means there are<br />
more tricks the players can call upon to pull their bacon out of the fire,<br />
while reducing the number of aspects gives them fewer. However, be careful<br />
about adjusting the number of aspects. The more aspects there are, the less<br />
important each aspect is and the more likely it is to be forgotten or ignored.<br />
Reducing the number of aspects means that each individual aspect becomes more<br />
important and less likely to be overlooked, but it also means you’ll have to<br />
make up for it to some extent with extra situation aspects. In general, more<br />
than seven aspects leads to aspect bloat, while fewer than three gives<br />
characters too little depth.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to think about adjusting refresh if you adjust the number of<br />
aspects. If you have a ton of aspects but low refresh, most of those won’t get<br />
invoked.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of power levels you can use for your own games.</p>
<h4 id="gritty-noir">GRITTY NOIR<a class="headerlink" href="#gritty-noir" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Eight skills: 3 Average (+1), 3 Fair (+2), 2 Good (+3) (15 skill points equivalent)</li>
<li>Skill cap at Good (+3)</li>
<li>Refresh 2</li>
<li>1 free stunt</li>
<li>2 stress boxes to start</li>
<li>5 aspects</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pulp-adventure">PULP ADVENTURE<a class="headerlink" href="#pulp-adventure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fifteen skills: 5 Average (+1), 4 Fair (+2), 3 Good (+3), 2 Great (+4), 1 Superb (+5) (35 skill points equivalent)</li>
<li>Skill cap at Superb(+5)</li>
<li>Refresh 4</li>
<li>5 free stunts</li>
<li>4 stress boxes to start</li>
<li>7 aspects</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="super-heroic">SUPER-HEROIC<a class="headerlink" href="#super-heroic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Eighteen skills: 5 Average (+1), 4 Fair (+2), 3 Good (+3), 3 Great (+4), 2 Superb (+5), 1 Fantastic (+6) (50 skill points equivalent)</li>
<li>Skill cap at Fantastic(+6)</li>
<li>Refresh 6</li>
<li>5 free stunts</li>
<li>Stunts are worth 3 shifts each</li>
<li>4 stress boxes to start; stunts can provide more</li>
<li>5 aspects</li>
</ul>
<p>These starting skill spreads are suggestions, made with Fate Core’s default 18<br />
-skills-long list in mind. If you use a longer skill list, the relative<br />
breadth of the starting skill sets changes. Look at the above in that light.<br />
Gritty Noir’s eight skills cover about 45% of the available skills, Fate<br />
Core’s default covers about 55%, Pulp Adventure’s is about 80%, and Super-<br />
Heroic’s is 100%.</p>
<p>This is a competence dial. It measures not only how well a PC can take on a<br />
specific kind task, but how many different kinds of tasks a given PC can excel<br />
at.</p>
