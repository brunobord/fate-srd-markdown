<h1 id="social-conflict">Social Conflict<a class="headerlink" href="#social-conflict" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The social skills in Fate Core (Deceive, Empathy, Provoke, Rapport) already<br />
give groups a variety of ways to approach social conflicts, but your group can<br />
also implement a system of <strong>motivations</strong> and <strong>instincts</strong> to provide PCs<br />
more opportunities to engage NPCs in social interactions.</p>
<h2 id="motivations-and-instincts">Motivations and Instincts<a class="headerlink" href="#motivations-and-instincts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Any NPC—even a nameless guard—has two components to their social logic: a<br />
motivation and an instinct that follows from that motivation. For example, a<br />
teacher may want to safeguard his students (<span class="aspect">Motivation: Protect<br />
His Students from Harm</span>) by keeping the players’ characters from<br />
interrogating a particular student (<span class="aspect">Instinct: Deny the PCs<br />
Access</span>). Any attempts to produce a change will require the PCs to<br />
either alter the NPC’s motivation or convince them that a different instinct<br />
better serves the motivation itself.</p>
<p>You might notice that most motivations double as situation aspects that can be<br />
invoked and compelled using fate points.</p>
<p>Remember the Bronze Rule!</p>
<h2 id="discovering-and-modifying-motivations">Discovering and Modifying Motivations<a class="headerlink" href="#discovering-and-modifying-motivations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Of course, motivations are sometimes difficult to detect. While some NPCs will<br />
clearly announce why they are opposing the PCs—“I’ve come to avenge my<br />
father!”—most people don’t run around shouting out their internal monologues<br />
to the world. In order to discover an NPC’s motivations, the PCs need to<br />
create advantages using an appropriate social skill. Characters can pick up on<br />
small clues (Empathy), challenge the NPC through taunts or provocative<br />
statements (Provoke), or even pretend to be someone the NPC can trust<br />
(Deceive), in order to discover NPC motivations.</p>
<p>Once the PCs know an NPC’s motivation, they can try to alter that motivation<br />
using a variety of social skills, replacing the motivation with a urgent<br />
concern based on new information (Rapport) or attempting to falsely convince<br />
the target that their motivation is based on bad assumptions (Deceive). For<br />
example, a loyal guard (<span class="aspect">Motivation: Follow My Boss’<br />
Orders</span>, <span class="aspect">Instinct: Kill the PCs</span>) might be scared off<br />
by a sufficiently impressive threat (Provoke) designed to change his<br />
motivation to <span class="aspect">Save My Own Skin</span>.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-instincts">Modifying Instincts<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-instincts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Rather than attempt to sway an NPC’s motivations, PCs may also create<br />
situations that demand more immediate attention or suggest that a different<br />
instinct would better serve the original motivation. For example, the PCs<br />
might start a fire (Provoke) in the lobby of the hotel to distract a hotel<br />
concierge (<span class="aspect">Motivation: Keep the Hotel Running Smoothly</span>) or<br />
try to convince a drug lord to part with the drugs for less (Rapport) on the<br />
promise that future shipments will make up the loss on volume<br />
(<span class="aspect">Motivation: Make Lots of Money</span>). These attempts to change<br />
the NPC’s instincts might move an NPC from <span class="aspect">Instinct: Keep the PCs<br />
Out</span> to <span class="aspect">Instinct: Put Out the Fire!</span> or from<br />
<span class="aspect">Instinct: Sell the Drugs at Market Prices</span> to<br />
<span class="aspect">Instinct: Sell the Drugs Cheap</span>. Ultimately these social<br />
interactions rely on the PCs’ ability to sell the new instinct as better<br />
serving the original motivation instead of changing the original motivation<br />
completely.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-contests-and-conflicts">Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-contests-and-conflicts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>For most attempts to modify NPC motivations or instincts, the PCs will need to<br />
make overcome rolls against an active opposition; the NPC rolls an appropriate<br />
social skill to see through the deception or resist the fast talk. In some<br />
cases it may make sense to use the contest mechanics—trying to convince a<br />
judge to let someone out of jail before the judge moves on to the next case—or<br />
conflict mechanics—union and management representatives conducting a hard-<br />
nosed negotiation that leaves both sides exhausted. Players should also keep<br />
in mind that their opponents have social strengths and weaknesses: it’s easier<br />
to convince a dim-witted, loyal guard with Average (+1) Empathy and Great (+4)<br />
Will that his boss wants him to let you in to the secret meeting (Deceive to<br />
modify instinct) than it is to convince him that he should abandon his boss<br />
altogether (Rapport to modify motivation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Romero and Amarika Davis are Los Angeles homicide detectives<br />
investigating the murder of a wealthy socialite, Richard Bentley. After<br />
digging through the case, they discover that Bentley’s wife, Sandra Orastin,<br />
is the killer. Yet when they show up to arrest her, one of her security guards<br />
keeps them from getting close enough to close the case (<span class="aspect">Instinct:<br />
Stop the Cops from Arresting My Boss</span>).</p>
<p>Knowing that a physical conflict would give Orastin a chance to escape,<br />
Amarika tries to talk her way past the guard, beginning with a Provoke roll to<br />
learn the guard’s motivation (create an advantage with Provoke). She has a<br />
Good (+3) Provoke and rolls well (+3), bringing her total up to Fantastic<br />
(+6). The guard, a nameless NPC with an Average (+1) Deceive, rolls decently<br />
(+2), but can’t help but reveal his motivation: he doesn’t want to get fired<br />
by letting his boss get arrested. The GM adds the aspect<br />
<span class="aspect">Motivation: Keep My Job</span> with two free invocations, since<br />
Amarika succeeded with style. Amarika asks him why he wants to protect a<br />
killer and the guard sputters something about doing his job even though he<br />
doesn’t like it.</p>
<p>Michael, seizing on the aspect Amarika discovered, decides that he’s going<br />
to try to alter the guard’s instinct. He suggests that if the guard wants to<br />
keep his job, he should help the police arrest Orastin. After all, the guard<br />
will definitely lose his job if Michael and Amarika have to arrest him, too.</p>
<p>Michael has a stronger Rapport (+3) than Provoke (+1) skill, so he focuses<br />
on convincing the guard instead of scaring him (overcome with Rapport).<br />
Michael’s roll is average (+0), but he uses the free invocation on<br />
<span class="aspect">Motivation: Keep My Job</span> to bring his roll up to a Superb<br />
(+5) result. The guard, with Fair (+2) Will rolls poorly (-2), and Michael<br />
convinces him that working with the police is the best way to fulfill his<br />
Motivation. Michael gains an additional boost <span class="aspect">Led by the<br />
Guards</span> for succeeding with style.</p>
