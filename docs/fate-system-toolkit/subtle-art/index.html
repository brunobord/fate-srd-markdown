<p>Mechanically speaking, this system is an elaboration of creating an advantage.<br />
That is, it simply expands the scope of when, where, and what kind of<br />
advantages can be created. Because it’s much more low-key than other magic<br />
types, it doesn’t answer a number of the big questions. This makes it a magic<br />
system better suited to a game that is not itself primarily magical. In fact,<br />
it’s best suited to games where there is some question of whether magic is<br />
real or not, though in other games it may be a way to represent a “lesser”<br />
path of magic.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When you imagine magical societies, the first thing to spring to mind may be<br />
ancient lodges and secret orders. Certainly those exist, but they don’t have<br />
much magic left in them—their own success tamped it out. Consider that the<br />
benefits of magic are ephemeral, while the benefits of collaboration,<br />
conspiracy, and partnership are concrete. For the kind of important,<br />
successful folks who meet in smoky rooms with dark woods and deep carpets, the<br />
magic is just window dressing. They don’t need to believe anymore, and in most<br />
cases, they haven’t needed to for a long time.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. Most of these established organizations started out full<br />
of belief and strong intentions, but that belief faded under the weight of<br />
their own success. It’s easy to believe that your prosperity charms are<br />
helping your stock picks when you have no idea what you’re doing, but as you<br />
succeed—and learn—then the tendency is to start attributing your successes to<br />
your talent and smart picks. That means, as you get better, magic helps you<br />
less.</p>
<p>As a result, most practicing magical groups are much more informal. Networks<br />
of friends, friends of friends, or loosely connected strangers sharing a<br />
common interest. Meetings mostly revolve around drinking, hook-ups, and couch<br />
surfing in cheap rented apartments.</p>
<p>The simple reality is that magic has its strongest roots in the rootless.<br />
People who are smart and capable, but lack direction or any real purpose,<br />
gravitate to magic for the quick fix solution it represents. It’s an<br />
underground, and for some, it’s the best weapon available.</p>
<h2 id="magic-and-reality">Magic and Reality<a class="headerlink" href="#magic-and-reality" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>What’s important is that there is no “real world” proof that this magic works.<br />
The introduction of these aspects does not change reality in any real,<br />
repeatable way. Certainly, they tilt the scale a bit, but they do so within<br />
the realm of reasonable outcomes. To an outside observer, this “magic” looks a<br />
lot like confirmation bias. If you put a curse on someone and something bad<br />
happens to them, then it’s easy to take credit for it, but a cynic will note<br />
that bad things happen to people all the time.</p>
<p>This can be rough, and as a result, believers tend to cluster together. They<br />
form subcultures where they can nerd out about what they’ve done, swap tips,<br />
and generally reinforce their belief that this is something that matters. In<br />
many ways, these groups are more important than the magic itself, but they are<br />
not what one might expect.</p>

<p>Don’t want to read it all? Just do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a skill called “Magic.”</li>
<li>Take a half hour in a dark room with someone’s name, a voodoo doll, or similar accouterments, and make a Magic roll to create an advantage against the target of the spell.</li>
<li>Put an aspect appropriate to a curse or blessing on the target. It lasts for three days, seven if you succeed with style.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This system adds one skill: Magic. Its description follows.</p>
<h2 id="skill-magic">Skill: Magic<a class="headerlink" href="#skill-magic" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Magic is the skill of placing blessings and curses upon a person or place.<br />
While the skill itself is generic, its specific manifestations are not. A<br />
practitioner must have a set of rules and trappings that they follow to use<br />
magic. Those rules may be based on a real-world practice, be totally made up,<br />
or anywhere in between, but they must be consistent and they always demand<br />
time, effort, and ritual. There are other limitations listed below.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">O</span> <strong>Overcome</strong>: There are few useful obstacles that<br />
magic may overcome, though many practitioners think otherwise. It’s a common<br />
misperception that the Magic skill can be used to “detect” magical workings,<br />
but this is really no more reliable than guessing.</p>
<p>The one concrete use for overcome is to overcome the skepticism of others. The<br />
Magic skill also represents how well you “sell” the idea of magic, or at least<br />
your belief. This works like a very specific sort of use of the Deceive<br />
skill—even if the character doesn’t feel he’s deceiving anyone.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">C</span> <strong>Create an Advantage</strong>: The primary activity with<br />
the Magic skill is creating an advantage. Assuming a single target—a person,<br />
or a thing perhaps as large as a house—about a half hour’s time, and the<br />
appropriate ritual trappings, the roll is made against a difficulty of<br />
Average. So long as the character gets a success, then the target gains the<br />
aspect of the blessing or curse—see below for details—for three days and three<br />
nights. Further modifications follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the target is not present, then the difficulty is increased from between +1 to +3. +3 if the target is merely named, +1 if a powerful symbolic tie to the target is present—their blood, a treasured possession—and if it’s not clearly either, then a +2 is appropriate.</li>
<li>If the target is large—a small group of less than a dozen or a large place like an office building or park—difficulty increases by +3. That’s the maximum size that a spell can actually work at, though most practitioners are unaware of this, and every year, hours of magic get wasted targeting the GOP, the Dallas Cowboys, and hipsters.</li>
<li>Some spells have a secondary target, such as a spell that makes your boss mad at someone. The absence of that secondary target similarly impacts the difficulty—+0 if present, +3 if you only have a name, as above. The one qualifier is that if the secondary target can be made to accept some token of the spell—a potion, a trinket—then they are effectively “present”. Such tokens must be used within three days.</li>
<li>Success with style extends the duration to a week.</li>
<li>No target can be the subject of more than one spell at a time. The newest spell replaces the existing ones.</li>
<li>Some blessings and curses have their own additional modifiers.</li>
<li>A spell on an area effectively creates a scene aspect that can be used normally by anyone in the location.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="fate_font">A</span> <strong>Attack</strong>: There is no such thing as a magical<br />
attack.</p>
<p><span class="fate_font">D</span> <strong>Defend</strong>: There is no such thing as a magical<br />
defense.</p>
<h3 id="spells">Spells<a class="headerlink" href="#spells" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Aspects put on a target are generally referred to as blessings or curses,<br />
depending on their intended effect, but collectively, they are all considered<br />
spells. These are not an open-ended list—there are a fixed set of spells, and<br />
the knowledge of them is the currency of the magical community. Spells are<br />
complicated enough that they are very difficult to commit to memory and still<br />
get exactly right, so they are kept in notebooks, databases, and other<br />
archives. Poaching another magician’s spellbook can be informative, but it can<br />
also be about as useful as their organic chemistry notes—even if they haven’t<br />
actively obscured them, they can be very idiosyncratic to understand. And, of<br />
course, there’s no real way to distinguish between a spell that’s a dud and a<br />
real one.</p>
<p>For clarity, the <strong>target </strong>of a spell is the person, place or thing it’s<br />
being cast on. Sometimes a spell will also have a <strong>subject</strong>, a person, place<br />
or thing which will be the focus of the spell’s effect on the target. For<br />
example, a love spell to make Jake fall for Andy would be cast on Jake (the<br />
target) focused on Andy (the subject).</p>
<p><strong>Annoyance</strong>: The target rubs people the wrong way. If the spell has a subject, then the target of the spell is more easily annoyed by that subject.</p>
<p><strong>Charisma</strong>: While related to love, this turns it on its head by improving the target’s general presence and demeanor. It’s sometimes a subject of ridicule—specifically, ridiculing those who would need such a spell—but it sees a lot of quiet use.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity</strong>: Popular among those who fancy themselves sophisticated magi, for many this spell is their morning cup of coffee, sharpening their thoughts and senses. It’s also a popular “counterspell,” used to remove curses.</p>
<p><strong>Clumsiness</strong>: You know those days where you dropped a glass, spilled your coffee in your lap, and ripped your shirt on a latch? This makes for that kind of day.</p>
<p><strong>Confusion</strong>: People tend to misunderstand the target—or get easily lost if it’s a place.</p>
<p><strong>Love</strong>: One of the most well known but also most contentious spells, especially when used with a subject. Without a subject, it simply makes the target more friendly towards the world, but with a subject, it inclines the subject toward the target. A lot of people view this as skeezy at best, and date rape at worst. It’s a touchy topic, and a number of magicians get around this by explicitly casting dud spells.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong>: The magical equivalent of fizzy tablets with vitamin C and zinc.</p>
<p><strong>Luck</strong>: This is the most common spell in circulation, and it can take the form of good or bad luck.</p>
<p><strong>Obscurity</strong>: The target is easily overlooked—by the subject, if appropriate. Whether this is a blessing or a curse depends a lot on your perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Prosperity</strong>: Another popular blessing, financial things fall the target’s way. It’s rare that this turns into a large windfall, but it can show up as a loan extension or a free beer.</p>
<p><strong>Rage</strong>: Small things annoy the target more than usual, as if they’d woken up on the wrong side of the bed. If the spell has a subject, then the target of the spell is more easily enraged by that subject.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong>: Keeps the target—or area—safer than it would be.</p>
<p>These are not all the spells available, but they should provide some insight<br />
into the tone of any additions.</p>
<h3 id="magic-stunts">Magic Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#magic-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>By Rote</strong>: You may pick three spells that you know well enough that you don’t need to consult your notes to cast.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Eye</strong>: You can attempt to put <span class="aspect">Bad Luck</span> on a target with nothing more than an obvious gesture. This lasts only a day.</p>
<p><strong>Interior Decorator</strong>: You may call it <em>feng shui</em> on your invoices, but it’s all just decor. If you put a spell on a place, you may arrange the furniture and decorations just so. If you do, the effect lasts for up to a season—or until someone rearranges the furnishings.</p>
<h2 id="variations-and-options">Variations and Options<a class="headerlink" href="#variations-and-options" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="but-does-it-work">But Does It Work?<a class="headerlink" href="#but-does-it-work" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It is entirely possible that this “system” is a lie. Magic doesn’t actually do<br />
anything, and it’s all wish fulfillment and confirmation bias. A GM could even<br />
pull this on a player, by quietly not accounting for the aspects they appear<br />
to create. That is, by and large, a terrible idea. It really hoses the player<br />
and undercuts their concept—unless they also like the idea of it being fake.</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize this idea—even if you don’t want to embrace it<br />
fully—then things that make the magic impossible to prove make great compels.</p>
<h3 id="jazzing-it-up">Jazzing It Up<a class="headerlink" href="#jazzing-it-up" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It’s also possible for this to be a more overtly magical system. In that case<br />
you can introduce odd, improbable, or super weird effects. This will require<br />
expanding the spell list to include more concrete things like “food rots when<br />
you touch it,” and it also makes spells something that can be concretely<br />
perceived by the magic skill. In this case, the duration of effects should be<br />
extended to a lunar month.</p>
<h3 id="combat-curses">Combat Curses<a class="headerlink" href="#combat-curses" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Assuming a more overt style of magic, a variant on this would allow for<br />
“combat casting” of blessings and curses. This is very different from the<br />
traditional image of the mage casting lightning bolts, but it suits lower<br />
magic settings very well. In this case, spells can be cast on any target in<br />
sight, and by and large, this allows for colorful create an advantage effects.</p>
<p>By default, these must be invisible effects, but can still cause bad choices<br />
to be made, weapons to miss and so on. However, if the GM deems it<br />
appropriate, then certain color may be allowed to make these overtly<br />
magical—such as a fire priest creating fiery advantages.</p>
<h4 id="wizards-duels">Wizards’ Duels<a class="headerlink" href="#wizards-duels" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If combat curses are supported, then so are wizards’ duels. A wizards’ duel<br />
occurs when two wizards meet and choose to lock eyes, entering battle, which<br />
uses Magic in lieu of Fight and inflicts mental damage until one or the other<br />
is taken out. To an external observer, all that happens is they lock eyes,<br />
then one collapses—possibly dead, depending on the decision of the victor. To<br />
the two wizards, the battle can take any form.</p>
<p>Sometimes, beings of greater power can be drawn into a duel by mortal magic.<br />
This requires some preparation on the part of the human practitioner, such as<br />
the creation of a focus object. These clashes still occur mostly in the ether,<br />
but they might involve a flashier exchange of energies or other effect. In<br />
such a case, if the greater power loses, the result is rarely fatal, but the<br />
being may carry a consequence forward.</p>
