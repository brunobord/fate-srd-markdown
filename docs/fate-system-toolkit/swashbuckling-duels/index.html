<p>The kind of cinematic, heroic action that typifies swashbuckling stories is<br />
near and dear to Fate Core’s heart—that’s just the nature of the game. But<br />
those climactic one-on-one fights between our hero and a dastardly villain<br />
almost always involve a lot of back-and-forth before one of them lands a blow.<br />
In the meantime, they might trade witty repartee or provocative insults, swing<br />
from chandeliers, leap off balconies, baffle their opponent with their cloak,<br />
or a thousand other things. Look at D’Artagnan and Jussac in The Three<br />
Musketeers, Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in the 1938 film The Adventures of<br />
Robin Hood, Cyrano’s poetry-laden duel with Valvert in Rostand’s Cyrano de<br />
Bergerac, or Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader’s duel in The Empire Strikes Back.</p>
<p>The create an advantage action in Fate Core makes it easy to model these sorts<br />
of conflicts, but most players will still gravitate toward the most efficient<br />
means of dispatching the opposition, especially if there aren’t other PCs<br />
around to give them an excuse to create situation aspects. That’s what this<br />
hack does—require players to rely on skills other than Fight in a conflict,<br />
with colorful results.</p>
<p>These one-on-one dueling rules introduce something called the <strong>upper hand</strong>.<br />
Only the duelist with the upper hand can actually use a skill with the attack<br />
action to inflict harm. The other duelist can take any _other _action, but<br />
cannot attack—until _they _get the upper hand, of course.</p>
<p>How does one get the upper hand? By succeeding with style with a skill <em>other<br />
_than one that deals harm in physical conflicts (Fight or Shoot, or whatever<br />
the equivalent is in your game). As soon as one combatant succeeds with style<br />
with one of these other skills, they get the upper hand. This _replaces _the<br />
action’s usual reward for succeeding with style, such as getting a boost or an<br />
extra free invocation. You get either the upper hand _or</em> the usual reward,<br />
but not both.</p>
<p>Use a token of some kind to represent the upper hand. Whatever it is, it<br />
should be something that can easily be handed back and forth, like a coin, a<br />
little plastic cocktail sword, an index card with a hand drawn on it, a<br />
fencing glove—whatever works for your group.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a physical conflict between two (and only two)<br />
participants, determine the turn order, as usual. If this involves a skill<br />
roll, and one of the two succeeds with style, they start the conflict with the<br />
upper hand—they got the jump on the other guy.</p>
<p>After that, the combatants can do any of the following every turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack, if they have the upper hand</li>
<li>Try to get the upper hand, if they don’t</li>
<li>Do something else—put down situation aspects, try to escape the conflict, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s highly recommended that you use the <a href="../..
/fate-system-toolkit/customized-tools">Stress-Free variant</a> with these rules. Otherwise, there’s a<br />
real risk of combats dragging out, instead of knocking _down _and dragging<br />
out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dekka, an Imperial Lawkeeper of Porthos V, is facing off against her arch-<br />
nemesis Xoren, the scheming cyborg and would-be usurper of the Celestial<br />
Throne, in the midst of the coronation ceremony. Each is a master of the<br />
photon blade, as they’ve demonstrated to one another multiple times in the<br />
past. Their high-tech weapons flicker brilliantly with a copyrighted hum. It’s<br />
on.</p>
<p>Dekka wins initiative with a +5 to Xoren’s +3—a success, but not one with<br />
style. She starts things off with a little patter, hoping to discover one of<br />
his aspects using Empathy. “What’s your damage, Xoren? Is there an algorithm<br />
for evil somewhere in your neuro-matrix? Or do you actually think this ploy is<br />
going to work?” She gets a +6, while Xoren gets a +2. Success with style!</p>
<p>“Evil?” he spits back. “Spend one day as a cyborg in this wretched wreck of<br />
an empire and you’ll gain a new appreciation for _true _evil!”</p>
<p>She discovers the aspect <span class="aspect">All Shall Suffer for My Pain!</span>,<br />
and chooses to gain the upper hand instead of taking the extra free<br />
invocation.</p>
<p>Now it’s Xoren’s turn. Being an evil cyborg, he grabs a bystander and flings<br />
him at Dekka, hoping to create an advantage with Physique. He beats Dekka by 4<br />
shifts—enough to gain the upper hand—but she uses that free invocation on<br />
<span class="aspect">All Shall Suffer for My Pain!</span> to reduce that to 2 shifts.<br />
Her player explains that Xoren, in his righteous rage, accidentally<br />
telegraphed his move. The GM buys it. Xoren puts a situation aspect of<br />
<span class="aspect">Civilians in Danger</span> in play, with one free invocation.</p>
<p>Dekka still has the upper hand, and she means to use it. Shoving the poor<br />
onlooker to one side and springing forward at Xoren with her photon blade, she<br />
attacks with Fight at +4, beating his Fight defense of +3. He capitalizes on<br />
the fact that she’s distracted by those <span class="aspect">Civilians in<br />
Danger</span>, using his free invocation to bump his total up to +5. After<br />
trading a couple more fate points, Dekka comes out ahead by a single shift.<br />
Since they’re using the Stress-Free variant, that means a mild consequence for<br />
Xoren—<span class="aspect">Faltering Confidence</span>.</p>
