<p>There are times you might want to reinforce something about your game’s genre.<br />
Creating issues that underscore the genre’s themes is a good way, and you can<br />
get a lot of mileage out of encouraging your players to create characters tied<br />
to the genre. Sometimes you want something mechanically unique, though.</p>
<p>When you use genre aspects, you’re making a change to the way aspects work in<br />
order to reinforce your chosen genre. Sometimes you’ll apply these changes to<br />
all aspects in the game, while other times you’ll want to restrict these<br />
changes to a specific subset of aspects, or even a single specific aspect. The<br />
ways in which you can change aspects are too varied to simply list here, so<br />
instead we’ll provide a few examples.</p>
<h2 id="low-powered-aspects">Low-Powered Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#low-powered-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is a sweeping change to all aspects in the game, and it’s good for<br />
emulating genres where the PCs are weaker than the forces arrayed against<br />
them, such as in horror or noir. The change is simple: when you invoke an<br />
aspect, you can reroll the dice you rolled or you can get a +2 to the roll,<br />
but you cannot choose the +2 option more than once per roll if you invoke<br />
multiple aspects. This means that an aspect only increases by a small number<br />
the _maximum _effort a PC can exert. This is going to cause failure to be more<br />
common, which means that failure needs to always be interesting, and it needs<br />
to move the action forward just as much as success does.</p>
<p>If you want to allow the PCs to get multiple aspect bonuses in certain<br />
situations, consider tying such things to a stunt, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Keen Senses:</strong> When you invoke aspects on a Notice roll, you can invoke any number of aspects, provided you have the fate points to cover the cost.</p>
<h2 id="quest-aspects">Quest Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#quest-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is a small change, but one that can reinforce the PCs’ shared goals. It<br />
works well in fantasy settings, or any other setting where the PCs act as a<br />
group toward some sort of large goal, such as slaying the dragon or rescuing<br />
the village from bandits.</p>
<p>Whenever the PCs accept a quest, the group works together to create a good<br />
aspect representing that quest. For example, if the PCs are trying to save the<br />
village from a bandit king, the group might create the quest aspect<br />
<span class="aspect">Martin Half-Heart Must Be Stopped!</span>. Any PC in the party<br />
can invoke this aspect, and it can be compelled as if it were on each PC’s<br />
character sheet, earning everyone a fate point.</p>
<p>If the PCs resolve a quest aspect, it’s a milestone. The scope of the<br />
milestone depends on the difficulty and length of the quest. <a href="../../fate-core/advancement-change">Learn more about<br />
milestones</a>.</p>
