<p>The skills in Fate Core are designed to offer a wide range of actions, broadly<br />
applicable to a number of different settings. That said, the skill list is the<br />
thing we expect you to change first. Your skill list should be rooted in your<br />
setting and should reinforce it; if the default skill list works for this,<br />
you’re in luck! In some cases it might _mostly _work for you, but you might<br />
have to add a skill or two, take one out, or rename a few. If you’re looking<br />
to make more extensive modifications to the skill list—or even the system<br />
itself—then this chapter is for you.</p>
