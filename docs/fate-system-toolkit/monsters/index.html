<h1 id="monsters">Monsters<a class="headerlink" href="#monsters" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The rules for NPCs in the Fate Core book are great for creating people—other<br />
humans whose goals put them into conflict with the PCs—but as the GM, you<br />
might also want to include a few monsters in your game. With these tools, you<br />
can create monsters that are inhuman and tricky, challenging players to find<br />
clever approaches when dealing with monstrous antagonists.</p>
<h2 id="instinct-aspects">Instinct Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#instinct-aspects" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To create interesting monsters, start by laying out some of the core drives<br />
that spur the monsters to action. What makes them take risks and chances? What<br />
do they care enough about to get in fights with the players about? It’s likely<br />
they have inhuman drives—desires that ordinary humans would probably never<br />
have.</p>
<p>Take your initial thoughts and condense them down into an <strong>instinct aspect</strong>.<br />
Monster characters can use their instinct aspect as normal, but they may add<br />
+3 to their roll instead of +2 when they invoke it. Monsters are often<br />
singularly driven to obtain their goals, and the players will have to work to<br />
overcome these foes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rey is running a game of urban horror. When he writes up a set of zombies,<br />
he gives them the instinct aspect <span class="aspect">Hungry for Brains</span>.<br />
Anytime that he invokes their aspect, they get a +3 to their roll.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="monster-abilities">Monster Abilities<a class="headerlink" href="#monster-abilities" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Monsters are distinct from other NPCs because their abilities tend to<br />
challenge the rules and disrupt the normal flow of conflicts. Many monsters<br />
are entire fight scenes waiting to happen, as the players have to figure out<br />
how to defeat an enemy that is changing up the rules on them.</p>
<p>Some examples of interesting monster abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard to Kill</strong>: Monsters can survive much more damage than other characters, either because of longer stress tracks—like Frankenstein’s monster—or because they can regenerate quickly—like the Hydra.</li>
<li><strong>Immune to Damage</strong>: Monsters are often immune to all damage save one type—such as vulnerability to silver—or until a specific condition has been met—such as destroying a specific magic item.</li>
<li><strong>Prone to Change</strong>: Monsters tend to transform themselves—like vampires who turn into bats to flee—or the environment—such as summoning additional minions in the middle of a fight.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it’s easy to see how these traits could be turned into stunts, they are<br />
often too powerful to be activated without spending a fate point. However, if<br />
you add such a cost, the players can grind down an enemy like the Hydra,<br />
waiting for you to run out of fate points. In addition to making your monsters<br />
weak, such costs make conflicts a drag. Who wants to play until the GM runs<br />
out of fate points?</p>
<p>Rather than add a cost, you can instead add a <strong>weakness </strong>to a monster in<br />
order to be able to activate a stunt without paying the fate point cost. If<br />
you add a <strong>lesser weakness</strong>, you must still pay a fate point at the start of<br />
the scene in which the monster uses the power, but if you add a greater<br />
weakness, you don’t have to pay any fate points at all to use the stunt.</p>
<p>When the PCs discover and use a lesser weakness, the monster can still use the<br />
stunt, but must now pay each time that it uses the stunt. If the PCs discover<br />
and use a greater weakness, however, the monster loses the stunt completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rey decides to create a demon named Masabra. He gives Masabra a stunt that<br />
makes the demon immune to physical stress at the cost of a fate point. Rey<br />
wants Masabra to be extremely dangerous, so he gives him a greater weakness of<br />
blessed weapons, allowing Masabra to use the stunt without paying a fate point<br />
cost. If the PCs ever acquire blessed weapons, Masabra would lose access to<br />
this stunt when he faced them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="multiple-zone-monsters">Multiple Zone Monsters<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-zone-monsters" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>For very large monsters (VLM), you can go even further by treating the monster<br />
itself as a map with several zones. In order to defeat such a monster, the<br />
characters need to defeat each zone independently, while navigating the<br />
obstacles between the zones. By statting up the monster in pieces, you can<br />
split up the PCs and give the monster a number of extra actions—one per<br />
zone—to convey the size of the foe and keep the conflict interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Elder Dragon of Ormulto is a VLM in Rey’s game. He’s so large that he<br />
has four separate zones: his two claws, his head, and his tail. When the<br />
players try to keep him from destroying an apartment building, they will need<br />
to deal enough stress to his head to bring him down. However, if they don’t do<br />
anything about his claws or tail, he will quickly rain destruction down upon<br />
the people the heroes are trying to protect. They will have to split up among<br />
the zones to keep him in check.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the size of VLMs, you can also create stunts that help to<br />
convey the theme and style of the monster. Many of these involve<br />
transformations, stunts that fundamentally alter the monster or change the<br />
nature of the fight, changes that are familiar to players who have previously<br />
fought video game boss monsters. As with smaller monsters, you can tie these<br />
stunts to weaknesses if you’d like to be able to activate them for free.</p>
<p>In order to mark the importance of the intermediary steps needed to defeat a<br />
gigantic monster—such as destroying a part of it or closing a portal from<br />
which it draws strength—VLMs gain an additional transformation stunt tied to<br />
their partial defeat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since his claws and tail are much weaker than his head, the Elder Dragon of<br />
Ormulto has a transformation stunt tied to the destruction of those zones on<br />
the map called Breath of Fire. If the PCs destroy one of his appendages, the<br />
Dragon activates the stunt to deal two stress to each character on the map,<br />
regardless of zone, and adds the situational aspect <span class="aspect">(Name) Is On<br />
Fire!</span> where (Name) is an important building or person near the fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the rules here can also be used to add interesting features to<br />
nonhuman characters that aren’t antagonists in the story. You could give the<br />
player’s familiar a stunt with a weakness that human NPCs could attempt to<br />
discover, or map out a spirit guardian the players summon across multiple<br />
zones.</p>
