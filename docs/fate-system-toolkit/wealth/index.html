<p>The importance of money in a game depends greatly on its genre. Fate Core<br />
suggests a Resources skill, but for genres in which the _acquisition _of<br />
wealth is often a prime motivator, such as cyberpunk or classic dungeon-<br />
crawling fantasy, you might want something a little more flexible.</p>
<h2 id="wealth-stress">Wealth Stress<a class="headerlink" href="#wealth-stress" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>One alternative is introducing a new stress track—<strong>Wealth</strong>. When you attempt<br />
something that would be made easier by the liberal application of cash, you<br />
can check a Wealth stress box for a bonus to your roll (see the <a href="../../fate-system-toolkit/customized-tools">Extra Effort<br />
stress variant</a>).</p>
<p>For example, if you’re haggling over the price of a hover-speeder using<br />
Rapport—or Provoke, if you’re being a real jerk about it—and you fail your<br />
roll, you could check a Wealth stress box to pay too much for it. Or perhaps<br />
you’re planning a heist and fail your Burglary roll? Check a Wealth stress box<br />
to get—or have gotten—the expensive gear you need to pull it off. Can’t find<br />
the assassin you’re looking for with Contacts? Maybe checking a Wealth stress<br />
box will improve your informants’ memories. And so on.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s succeeding at a serious cost, where that cost is<br />
literally a <em>cost</em>.</p>
<h3 id="starting-wealth">Starting Wealth<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-wealth" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This will vary depending on your game—are the PCs professionals with steady<br />
work, or are they living sword-hand-to-mouth?—but starting off with a base of<br />
two Wealth stress boxes is a happy medium. PCs get +1 stress box for each<br />
aspect they have that relates to how well off they are, to a maximum of +3<br />
stress boxes.</p>
<h3 id="gaining-wealth">Gaining Wealth<a class="headerlink" href="#gaining-wealth" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Wealth stress doesn’t go away on its own. Instead, you can only clear a<br />
checked box when you gain more loot—gold, credits, barter, or whatever else<br />
works for your game. Acquiring a parcel of Wealth lets you clear any number of<br />
stress boxes whose total values don’t exceed the parcel’s value. If you have<br />
one or more checked boxes of a value greater than that of the Wealth parcel<br />
you’ve received, do nothing to the boxes that exceed the parcel’s value—it’s<br />
not enough Wealth to make a difference to you. For example, if you acquire 3<br />
Wealth, you can clear your first, second, or third stress box, if any one of<br />
them is checked, or both your first and second stress boxes—but not your<br />
fourth, if you’re lucky enough to have one.</p>
<p>The only way to _add _stress boxes is at a milestone, by swapping out an<br />
existing aspect for a wealth-oriented one.</p>
