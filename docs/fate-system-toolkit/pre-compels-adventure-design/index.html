<p>If you’re stuck for an adventure idea, you need look no further than the PCs’<br />
aspects! Here’s a neat trick to kick-start an adventure and also start the<br />
players off with some extra fate points.</p>
<p>First, take a look at all of the PCs’ aspects and see if any jump out at you.<br />
If you see one that seems to have an interesting adventure hook, particularly<br />
something that’s tied to the world or an organization within the world, tell<br />
the player you want to use it as the seed of an adventure and offer him a fate<br />
point. Most players will accept this compel without much convincing, but if<br />
the player isn’t interested, don’t charge him a fate point for refusal—just<br />
come up with a different aspect to compel.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got your seed, open it up to the table. Suggest other aspects and<br />
solicit suggestions from the players. Talk with them about what’s going to<br />
show up in the adventure and hand out fate points for good suggestions. These<br />
suggestions don’t <em>have</em> to be tied to aspects, but it’s best if they are.<br />
After all, if you’re tying multiple aspects into the story, you can keep<br />
compelling that aspect later!</p>
<p>If you do take suggestions not based on existing aspects, turn those<br />
suggestions <em>into</em> aspects. They can be situation aspects or they can be<br />
aspects placed on the entire adventure.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got a good starting point, start playing! Now you’ve got a<br />
starting situation with a lot of player buy-in, and the players have some<br />
extra fate points so that they can be extra-awesome from the start!</p>
