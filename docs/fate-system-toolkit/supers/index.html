<p>Fate characters are already incredibly competent and accomplished folks, but<br />
sometimes your group might want to push the system even further, telling a<br />
story of actual superheroes who fight crime and supervillains who want to<br />
conquer the world. This section will give you a few tools to make superheroes<br />
work for your group!</p>
<h2 id="origin-stories">Origin Stories<a class="headerlink" href="#origin-stories" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Fate superheroes are a lot like regular Fate characters, but they can replace<br />
the trouble phase of character creation with an origin story, an aspect that<br />
quickly summarizes how the character acquired superpowers and/or why those<br />
powers cause the hero problems. Remember that aspects should always be double-<br />
edged, noting the character’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, a hero<br />
might take the high concept <span class="aspect">Genetically Engineered<br />
Supersoldier</span> to represent his superhuman strength and agility and the<br />
origin story <span class="aspect">Dimensional Traveler</span> to simultaneously note<br />
that he’s a fish out of water in our world.</p>
<h2 id="super-skills">Super Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#super-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>One way of creating superpowers in Fate is to allow players to designate<br />
skills as superpowers, instead of taking stunts. A hero born on an advanced<br />
alien world might take Super Lore. A teen touched by the powers of an ancient,<br />
primordial god might take Super Athletics. Heroes that use technology or<br />
magical items can invest the skills into the item itself as skill extras,<br />
carrying Spears of Destiny (Physique) or building fantastic clockwork robots<br />
(Shooting).</p>
<p>Heroes can use the skill as normal, but can also opt to make use of the power<br />
by spending a fate point. When activated, the superskill allows the hero to<br />
attempt fantastic feats, doubling his current skill bonus. After rolling, the<br />
characters must step back the skill by one. As long as the skill is not<br />
reduced to zero, the power refreshes next scene. If the power is exhausted,<br />
however, the hero will have to find some way to rest or recharge before using<br />
it again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maxine, a Valkyrie with Superb Physique (+5), can spend a fate point to<br />
throw a car at a supervillain—adding 5 extra shifts to her roll—but after the<br />
roll the skill steps back to Great (+4). If she continues to use her<br />
superstrength to the point that her Physique is exhausted, she will need to<br />
journey to Valhalla to drink from the Horn of Might to regain her strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This system lends itself to Golden Age-style heroes who achieve amazing feats<br />
with few downsides beyond getting tired or running out of power. It also gives<br />
the GM a chance to set up interesting refresh scenes (see <a href="../../fate-system-toolkit/refresh">Refresh</a>), when the heroes have to recharge their<br />
powers, reconnect with their human lives, or rest for long enough to face the<br />
villain at full strength. For example, a teenage hero might need to head back<br />
home to connect with her dad, while a shapechanging nightstalker might retire<br />
to his lair to sleep through the day before resuming his hunt.</p>
<h2 id="creating-super-powered-stunts">Creating Super-Powered Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-super-powered-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If your group prefers more defined superpowers, you can allow players to<br />
purchase superpowers as stunts, perhaps even giving them an extra stunt or two<br />
for free. For a low-powered superhero game, emulating gritty 1980s antiheroes,<br />
the existing stunts in Fate Core are probably fine—the heroes aren’t empowered<br />
paragons, just extraordinary people who put on costumes.</p>
<p>If you want to tell more epic superhero stories, you can also write stunts<br />
that allow for stronger powers but require the player to bid fate points.<br />
Static obstacles may be defeated by spending a single fate point, but other<br />
superpowered characters can accept, cancel, or raise the action by bidding a<br />
fate point back and narrating opposition. This goes back and forth until one<br />
character is unwilling to spend any more points. If the action ends in a tie,<br />
the points are given to the GM, but if one character clearly wins, the loser<br />
gets all the fate points bid. Note that this might result in dramatic swings<br />
in the fate point economy, as one player is going to catch a windfall of fate<br />
points at the end of a conflict.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sergio is a hero with Bend Bars, Lift Gates, a stunt that allows him to<br />
destroy physical impediments by bidding a fate point. If no superpowered<br />
characters oppose him, the action is successful without a roll. However, if<br />
Maxine uses her Norse powers to shock him through the metal bars he’s trying<br />
to bend, she can spend a fate point to cancel his action or spend two fate<br />
points to try to apply her power (Lighting Storm) in addition to canceling his<br />
stunt. If she spent two fate points, Sergio would get a chance to bid back to<br />
cancel or raise, or he could accept her action and claim the two fate points<br />
she bid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fate Worlds setting Wild Blue has some awesome ideas for creating powers<br />
as stunts with narrative costs, such as time travel that a hero can’t quite<br />
control, or telepathy that always uncovers unwanted information. Check it out<br />
for another way of creating powers in Fate!</p>
<p>Similarly, superpowers by any other name might be called <em>magic</em>. Have a look<br />
at the previous chapter to get an idea of how you could do something more<br />
involved and intricate with your superpowers by way of building them as a<br />
“magic” system.</p>
<h2 id="villains-and-sidekicks">Villains and Sidekicks<a class="headerlink" href="#villains-and-sidekicks" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Fate already has <a href="../../fate-core
/creating-and-playing-opposition">great rules for generating NPCs</a>. For superhero stories, the GM can designate<br />
these as minions, villains, and supervillains to better signal to the heroes<br />
the level of danger each group poses.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to the suggestions in Fate Core for grouping up<br />
minions and treating them as obstacles. Sometimes the best way to portray a<br />
hero beating up on a group of low-level thugs is a single roll or expenditure<br />
of a superpower.</p>
<p>Villains should look a little more like the heroes themselves, probably<br />
picking up a superpower or two. Ideally you want a group of villains to be<br />
able to take on your heroes toe-to-toe for long enough to make a contest<br />
interesting, but they probably aren’t the real threat your heroes face.</p>
<p>Supervillains, however, can be full-fledged characters, complete with high<br />
concepts, origin stories, superpowers, and extras of their own. Don’t skimp on<br />
origin stories for your supervillains; they are a great place to get the<br />
flavor of the character across to the players. An evil cultist might have the<br />
origin story <span class="aspect">I’ve Lost the Only Man I Could Ever Love</span><br />
while a demonic supersoldier might have the origin story <span class="aspect">Doomed<br />
to Wander the Earth by Forces Infernal</span>.</p>
<p>Heroes can also pick up sidekicks (see <a href="../..
/fate-system-toolkit/sidekicks-vs-allies">Sidekicks vs. Allies</a>) and minions of their own as your<br />
story goes on, purchasing them as extras when they achieve milestones.</p>
