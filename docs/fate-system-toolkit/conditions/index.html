<p>Consequences are a great way to handle injuries, emotional scarring, and other<br />
persistent conditions within the fiction of your game. They’re not for<br />
everyone, though. Some people have trouble coming up with good consequences on<br />
the fly, while others want something more defined and concrete. Still others<br />
just want something different.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions </strong>are like consequences, except that they’re pre-defined, like this:</p>
<p><strong>Fleeting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 <span class="fate_font">1</span> Angry</li>
<li>1 <span class="fate_font">1</span> Frightened</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sticky</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 <span class="fate_font">1</span> Exhausted</li>
<li>2 <span class="fate_font">1</span> Hungry</li>
</ul>
<p>Lasting</p>
<ul>
<li>4 <span class="fate_font">1</span> <span class="fate_font">1</span> Broken</li>
<li>4 <span class="fate_font">1</span> <span class="fate_font">1</span> Wounded</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three kinds of conditions: fleeting, sticky, and lasting. A fleeting<br />
condition goes away when you get a chance to catch your breath and calm down.<br />
In the example above, Angry and Frightened are fleeting conditions. A <strong>sticky<br />
condition</strong> stays checked off until a specific event happens. If you’re<br />
Exhausted, you’re Exhausted until you get some sleep. If you’re Hungry, you’re<br />
Hungry until you get a good meal. Wounded and Broken are both <strong>lasting<br />
conditions</strong>. These stick around for at least one whole session, and require<br />
someone to overcome an obstacle with a passive opposition of at least Great<br />
(+4) before you can start to recover from them. Lasting conditions have two<br />
check boxes next to them, and you check them both off when you take the<br />
condition. When recovery begins, erase one check box. Erase the second one<br />
(and recover from it fully) after one more full session. You can take a<br />
lasting condition only if _both _of its check boxes are empty.</p>
<p>You suffer from a condition when the GM says you suffer from a<br />
condition—usually as a result of your narrative situation—but you can also use<br />
them to soak stress. When you take stress, you can reduce that stress by 1 if<br />
you check off a fleeting condition, by 2 stress if you check off a sticky<br />
condition, or by 4 stress if you check off a lasting condition. You can check<br />
off as many conditions as you’d like for a single hit.</p>
<p>Once you’re suffering from a condition, that condition is an aspect on your<br />
character sheet like any other. In this way, conditions are a lot like<br />
consequences—you can invoke them, and they can be invoked or compelled against<br />
you. As with a consequence, when you take a condition, someone else can invoke<br />
it against you for free once.</p>
<p>If you’re going to use conditions in your game, one thing you can do to<br />
reinforce the theme or style of your game is to come up with your own<br />
conditions. You don’t have to stick to the same spread of two fleeting/two<br />
sticky/two lasting as presented here, but you should stick to the same total<br />
number of shifts of stress-soaking: 14. Also make sure to follow the<br />
guidelines for the different types of conditions—fleeting conditions go away<br />
quickly, sticky conditions require a narrative trigger, and lasting conditions<br />
require treatment. The conditions above are non-specific enough to be used in<br />
a wide variety of settings, but tailoring conditions to your setting can be an<br />
effective way to make the characters feel more like a part of that setting.</p>
<p>As an example, here are alternate conditions from Jason Morningstar’s Fight<br />
Fire (found in <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/119383/Fate-Worlds-Worlds-on-
Fire?affiliate_id=144937"><em>Fate Worlds: Worlds on<br />

"I mainly put them in [the extra 2 stress boxes] to make up for the fact that<br />
a high skill doesn't give you any additional conditions the way a high<br />
Physique or Will would give you extra consequences.﻿"</p>
