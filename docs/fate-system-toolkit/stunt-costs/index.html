<h1 id="stunt-costs">Stunt Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#stunt-costs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In Fate Core, you get three free stunts, three refresh, and you can buy up to<br />
two additional stunts at the cost of one refresh each. This is the default way<br />
to handle stunts, but it is by no means the _only _way. Each of these<br />
components—number of starting stunts, starting refresh, and cost of each<br />
stunt—is a dial you can turn in either direction, making stunts more or less<br />
common as you do. How you turn those dials will determine, in part, what kind<br />
of game you’re playing, as well as having an impact on Milestones.</p>
<p>More stunts means more powerful PCs. A PC with more stunts can bring to bear<br />
larger bonuses on rolls, use her peak skills more often, and break the rules<br />
more frequently. It leads to a more pulpy, larger-than-life, even fantastical<br />
feel. If that’s what you want, great! Consider, though, that giving PCs more<br />
stunts also gives them more conditional benefits and exceptions to the rules,<br />
which makes for more complex characters. If the players aren’t used to this<br />
complexity, this can slow down play at the table and make things <em>less</em><br />
exciting rather than more.</p>
<p>On the flip side of things, giving the PCs fewer stunts makes their characters<br />
simpler and easier to run at the table, but also makes them a little less<br />
competent. A PC with only one stunt, for example, has one “schtick” that he<br />
can call upon, one signature move. That can mean a grittier game or a game<br />
where the PCs have clearly defined roles and a lot of niche protection, but it<br />
can also bore players that like a lot of rules or disappoint players that want<br />
to be good at a lot of stuff. PCs will still be competent, but not _as<br />
_competent.</p>
<h2 id="adjusting-starting-stunts">Adjusting Starting Stunts<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-starting-stunts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This is the easiest way to give PCs more or fewer stunts. Reducing it to zero<br />
means that a PC starts with no stunts, and will have to pay a dear price for<br />
each stunt she wants to pick up. This can make stunts feel more expensive, but<br />
it can also make individual stunts more important to PCs. Adjusting it in the<br />
other direction—giving PCs more starting stunts—gives players a lot of fun<br />
choices to make about their characters right out of the gate at no cost. It<br />
also brings up the baseline power level for each PC, making it more likely<br />
that your PCs will be highly competent at a wider variety of tasks, or<br />
seriously good at one or two. In addition, it has the effect of making stunts<br />
seem less expensive, which can encourage players to take even more.</p>
<p>One thing to keep an eye on when you’re adjusting starting stunts is what your<br />
players want. Are all of your players okay with a less powerful baseline<br />
character, or a more complex one? Not everyone wants to struggle for every<br />
victory or make a dozen choices before play begins.</p>
<h2 id="adjusting-starting-refresh">Adjusting Starting Refresh<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-starting-refresh" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Of these three options, adjusting refresh has probably the most profound<br />
impact on gameplay, because it directly affects the fate point economy that<br />
powers the game. Giving players more fate points each session means they’re<br />
likely to resist compels more often and invoke aspects more often. It gives<br />
players more control over the story, which can be a good thing, but also makes<br />
it a little harder to challenge them.</p>
<p>Reducing refresh has the opposite effect—players have less control over the<br />
story, because they have fewer fate points on hand. They have to accept more<br />
compels and they don’t get to invoke their aspects as often. It also means<br />
they’ll rely more on free invocations from creating advantages, which might<br />
lengthen big fight scenes.</p>
<h2 id="adjusting-stunt-cost">Adjusting Stunt Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-stunt-cost" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Making stunts cost one refresh is one way to do things, but not the only way.<br />
You can adjust this dial slightly by increasing or decreasing the amount of<br />
refresh a player must pay for a stunt. Maybe stunts cost two refresh, or maybe<br />
a single refresh buys the player two stunts.</p>
<p>There are other ways to fiddle with stunt costs, though. Maybe a player has to<br />
give up a skill point in order to buy a stunt, lowering a Good (+3) skill to<br />
Fair (+2) in order to pick up that stunt he wants. Maybe he has to give up an<br />
aspect or devote an aspect to that stunt in order to get it. Having to tie an<br />
aspect to a new stunt can make for stunts players are more attached to, and<br />
sets a nice upper limit on the number of stunts they can have.</p>
<p>Another way to do it is to make stunts free or very low-cost, but build the<br />
cost into each stunt. Maybe each stunt costs a fate point to activate, or<br />
requires you to take stress, or costs an action to activate, or gives an enemy<br />
a boost. You can build any number of costs into the use of a stunt.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, stunts are priced the way they are, giving the benefits they do,<br />
because they <em>permanently</em> cost the character a fate point by reducing<br />
refresh. That’s a fate point that can’t be spent flexibly to get a +2 or<br />
similar benefit during play. So if you’re planning to change what stunts cost,<br />
you should also think about tweaking the benefits gained to match what’s been<br />
“lost” to the cost.</p>
<h2 id="somewhere-in-between">Somewhere In Between<a class="headerlink" href="#somewhere-in-between" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Most solutions will require adjusting multiple dials to find the sweet spot<br />
for a particular group. That’s totally fine. This is your game, and it’s up to<br />
you and your group to determine what works for you.</p>
