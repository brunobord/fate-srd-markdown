#  Modifying the Setting: Making Big Changes

While Fate characters are always protagonists, sometimes the players decide
they want to modify the setting itself, cleaning up the mean streets of a
crime-ridden town or securing a military fortification against future attacks.

## Discover the Problems Before You Solve Them

First, the players must gather the information they need to do the job.
Perhaps the characters need to collect their existing experience—“Isn’t
Bastion the main drug runner in town?”—or maybe they need to make new
Contacts, Investigate, or Lore rolls to uncover old alliances and lost
knowledge. Either way, the group should construct a series of **setting
aspects** that represent the existing problem.

> To clean up the streets, a group might list:

>

>   * <span class="aspect">Local Drug Pushers</span>

>   * <span class="aspect">Midlevel Drug Mules</span>

>   * <span class="aspect">Drug Financiers</span>

>   * <span class="aspect">Corrupt Cops</span>

>   * <span class="aspect">Crime Kingpin, Marty O’Banner</span>

>

## Episode by Episode

For each setting aspect the group wants to reform, the group must roll against
an appropriate difficulty for resolving that problem. For example, arresting
all the <span class="aspect">Local Drug Pushers</span> might require the characters to
make a Resources roll to mobilize the existing police officers, or a Physique
roll to actually capture the bad guys themselves. While the characters can
invoke their own aspects, the GM can pay fate points to invoke the existing
setting aspects—such as <span class="aspect">Corrupt Cops</span>—complicating the
players’ progress.

For each roll, use the outcome to drop the characters into the middle of a
situation—like a TV episode—that reflects the results of the roll. On a losing
roll, the <span class="aspect">Local Drug Pushers</span> have gone to ground, and it’s
going to take some digging to get them out. On a successful roll, the group
has rounded up the bad guys, but needs to get them to start talking. Either
way, if the characters manage to resolve the situation, flip the setting
aspect to a positive, turning <span class="aspect">Local Drug Pushers</span> into
<span class="aspect">A Few Clean Streets</span>.

Once they start to make progress, let the group freely invoke previously
resolved setting aspects that apply, as the job might get easier when they
work their way up the chain.

## We Need a Montage!

If you’re less interested in playing out the day-to-day changes needed to
reform a criminal justice system or fortify a castle, you can instead
construct montages for your characters’ progress. Set a time limit—including a
limited number of actions—that represent that time and resources the
characters have available to resolve the situation before the story picks up
in full.

For each roll, the characters attempt to resolve one of the discovered aspects
using appropriate skills. Characters can work together, or they can split up
to try to solve multiple problems. In this style of making big changes,
narrate the group’s success like a movie montage, pausing only long enough at
each roll to see the group succeed or fail to improve the situation.
