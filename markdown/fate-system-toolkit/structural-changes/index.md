#  Structural Changes

So far all of these systems still assume something that looks like the current
skill list in most important ways—there’s a list arranged in a certain way,and
a progressive set of bonuses. But those assumptions need not be universal—you
can do some crazy stuff by stepping outside of the normal bounds.

## Pyramid Alternatives

The most obvious hack is to replace the [pyramid](../../fate-
core/skills), with a column system—as is used in advancement—with a point-buy
system, or even something like skill packages from specific backgrounds. This
is really something you can change quite freely, but before you do, just be
sure you understand why the pyramid is in place. It is fast, it demands
characters be capable (the apex) but well-rounded (the foundation), and it
makes sure that not every character can do everything (the skills you can’t
buy). It’s not unreasonable to change these—a superspy game, for example,
might have characters with very broad skill bases—but make sure you know what
problem you’re solving when you make the change.

## Larger Steps

Nothing says skills need to progress smoothly. Suppose that each “rank” of a
skill was actually two steps on the ladder—you might now have a pyramid of 1
Superb (+5), 2 Good (+3) and 3 or 4 Average (+1), and if you’re feeling mean,
move the default down to Poor (-1).

Why do this? Suppose you have a small skill list, as you might for professions
or approaches. You get a heroically potent pyramid—more so than the default,
even—for a smaller list. It also strongly separates the “tiers” of skill
level, something that may be thematically appropriate in certain genres.

## Aspects Only

If you want to take a very extreme step, you can forgo skills entirely, and
use aspects for everything. This requires a single change to the way aspects
work. Now, in addition to everything else, they provide a passive +1 bonus in
situations where they apply. Thus, if my aspects are
<span class="aspect">Acrobatic</span>, <span class="aspect">Ladies’ Man</span>,
<span class="aspect">Strong</span>, and <span class="aspect">Swordsman</span>, I can count on
a +2—effectively a Fair skill—in most sword-fighting situations involving
strength, which bumps to a Good (+3) if I do something acrobatic.

If taking this tack, some extra thought will need to go into aspect selection
so that everyone has a good understanding of when their aspects are and aren’t
applicable. The first instinct of many players will be to gun for broad,
simple aspects, like strong or smart, because they’re so easy to apply in most
situations. However, the real advantage will go to players who take the time
to put a bit more story into their aspects. <span class="aspect">Knight</span> covers
a lot of ground, but <span class="aspect">Knight of the Stars</span> covers even more,
and <span class="aspect">Renegade Knight of the Stars</span> covers even more. As is
so often the case, the most interesting characters will be the most
mechanically potent.
