#  Gadgets and Gear

Equipment in Fate Core can be as simple as an aspect, like
<span class="aspect">Magnetic Grapnel</span> Gun, or a stunt, like “_Magnetic Grapnel
Gun_: +2 to overcome with Athletics by climbing or swinging when there’s a
metal anchor around.” But for a little more depth, you can combine those into
a single extra as a **gadget**.

## Functions and Flaws

Gadgets come with two aspects for free—a **function** **aspect **and a **flaw
aspect**. The function tells you the gadget’s purpose, and the flaw tells you
what’s wrong with it. You can think of its function as its high concept and
its flaw as its trouble or a consequence that never goes away. These do not
take up any of your character’s personal aspects.

### Magnetic Grapnel Gun

**Function**: <span class="aspect">High-Powered Electromagnetic Swingline</span>  
**Flaw**: <span class="aspect">Still Working Out the Bugs</span>

## Stunts

Give the gadget one or more stunts to reflect the reliable mechanical
advantages it confers on its user. These stunts cost one refresh apiece.

### Magnetic Grapnel Gun

#### Aspects

**Function**: <span class="aspect">High-Powered Electromagnetic Swingline</span>  
**Flaw**: <span class="aspect">Still Working Out the Bugs</span>

#### Stunts

**CLANG!**: Spend a fate point to secure the magnetic grapnel to a metallic object in a dramatic way, grabbing a swiftly moving vehicle, a falling pulse rifle, or the wall on the other side of a yawning chasm in an oddly built space station.

**Trick Shots**: +2 to create an advantage with Shoot when you use the grapnel gun to swing around, disarm an opponent, or create a barrier.

#### Cost: 2 refresh

Gadgets don’t have to be literal “gadgets,” either. For example, you can just
as easily use these rules to create magic items in a fantasy setting.

### The Ring of Truth

#### Aspects

**Function**: <span class="aspect">Magical Lie Detector</span>  
**Flaw**: <span class="aspect">Wearer Is Cursed to Tell the Truth</span>

#### Stunts

**Pierce the Veil of Lies**: Spend a fate point. Three times during the scene, you can ask the GM if someone is lying, and she must answer you truthfully.

#### Cost: 1 refresh

## Additional Flaws

You can take additional flaws to reduce a gadget’s refresh cost, at a rate of
one refresh per additional flaw. The minimum cost for a gadget with any stunts
is 1 refresh, regardless of how many flaws it has.

GMs, it can’t be some weaksauce flaw, either, like <span class="aspect">Kinda Glitchy
on the Ocean Floor</span>. And if you do let something like that slip by, make
sure the player knows they can expect to spend a surprising amount of time
underwater. Deep, deep underwater.

> An additional flaw for the Magnetic Grapnel Gun might be <span class="aspect">Heavy
and Unwieldy</span>.

>

> The Ring of Truth could have an additional flaw of <span class="aspect">Hunted by
the Servants of Ssask, God of Lies</span>.
