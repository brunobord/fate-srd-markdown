#  Squad-Based Action

What if you want to play a squad of characters who are conscripted to storm
the beaches at Normandy on D-Day? Can you use Fate to play a squad of space
marines?

Yes, sir. Yes, you can.

These rules, like everything in Fate, are flexible enough to work with a
variety of skins, accommodating modern military units, World War II squads,
high fantasy armies, and futuristic bug-hunting mechs.

## Creating Squads

First, create characters normally (see Fate Core, page 30). While you’re
writing up your characters, name your squad and describe the role it plays in
the greater force. Is it a ragtag bunch of ex-felon soldiers? Or a highly
trained force of well-equipped professionals?

Whatever you decide, turn the description into two aspects, a **squad
concept** for your squad, and a **squad trouble** that always seems to plague
your unit. Any player in the unit can invoke these aspects and be compelled by
them.

> Lara, Antonio, and Michelle decide that their squad is a bootstrapped group
of survivors who are fighting back after alien forces nearly destroyed New
Orleans. After creating individual characters, they name their squad the Ninth
Ward Defenders, giving it the squad concept <span class="aspect">Dogs of War</span> to
represent their scrappy resilience and the squad trouble <span class="aspect">In Over
Our Head</span> to show that the aliens are dominant.

## Squad Skills

Unlike individual skills, squad skills can be used to reshape the whole
battlefield. For example, your soldier might lead a charge against the enemy’s
line or call in reinforcements to soften hardened defenses.

After creating the unit aspects, give your unit:

  * One Fair (+2) squad skill
  * Two Average (+1) squad skills
  * One Squad Stunt

If you want to emphasize the squad over the individual characters, reduce your
characters’ starting stunts and refreshes from three to two, and cap your
skills at Good (+3) instead of Great (+4).

## Operations

The Operations skill measures your unit’s ability to work together on the
battlefield, eliminating enemy units and securing key strategic positions.

<span class="fate_font">O</span> **Overcome**: Operations allows you to overcome
obstacles as a unit, such as when you lay down cover fire to reach a wounded
soldier safely or work together to climb over a wall.

<span class="fate_font">C</span> **Create an Advantage**: When you create an advantage
with Operations, your unit is setting traps (<span class="aspect">Ambush!</span>) or
charging directly at the barricades (<span class="aspect">Panicked Grunts</span>).

<span class="fate_font">A</span> **Attack**: Operations allows your squad to launch
coordinated attacks against targets and should be rolled instead of an
individual character’s Fight or Shoot whenever the squad acts as a unit.

<span class="fate_font">D</span> **Defend**: Operations is rolled for defense when
your unit attempts to retreat from the larger combat zone or otherwise avoid
an enemy attack as a group.

### Operations Sample Stunts

**Hard to Pin Down**: Take a +2 on any Overcome roll made to retreat from a combat zone.

**Blitzkrieg**: Your squad is fast, light, and deadly. Take +2 on all Operation rolls in which your attack focuses on catching the enemy off-guard.

## Equipment

The Equipment skill represents the resources your squad has available to
pursue its objectives.

<span class="fate_font">O</span> **Overcome**: Like the Resources skill, Equipment can
be used to get the squad through a situation that requires some additional
gear. The squad might call in some trucks to carry them over rough terrain or
even call in a bombing run.

<span class="fate_font">C</span> **Create an Advantage**: Your squad might use
Equipment to get some high-powered weaponry for a particular mission
(<span class="aspect">Flamethrowers!</span>) or to procure resources that are crucial
for navigation (<span class="aspect">Topographical Maps</span>).

<span class="fate_font">A</span> <span class="fate_font">D</span> **Attack / Defend**:
Equipment isn’t used to attack or defend.

### Equipment Sample Stunts

**Hi-Tech Gear**: You can use Equipment instead of Operations in any situation where raw technological superiority would win the day.

**Well-Stocked**: You gain a +2 on all Equipment rolls made to create an advantage when you are accessing your preexisting supplies.

## Recon

<span class="fate_font">O</span> **Overcome**: Recon isn’t used often to overcome
obstacles, but it can be used, like Notice, to give the squad a chance to head
off ambushes or traps.

<span class="fate_font">C</span> **Create Advantage**: Your squad can use Recon during
a battle to pierce the fog of war, gathering information beyond your immediate
location.

<span class="fate_font">A</span> <span class="fate_font">D</span> **Attack / Defend**: Recon
isn’t used to attack or defend.

### Recon Sample Stunts

**Codebreakers**: On a successful Recon roll to create an advantage while monitoring enemy communications, you can discover or create one additional aspect (though this doesn’t give you an extra free invocation).

**Counterprogramming**: You can use Recon instead of Operations to set a trap when you use the enemy’s communications system against them.

## Rolling Squad Skills

In order to make a squad skill roll or use a squad stunt, one player must
decide to give up his personal action to rally the group. The nature of
rallying will depend on the situation—military units typically follow
orders—but generally the player will need the support of most of the other
player characters.

If he’s successful in directing the squad, the difficulty of the task drops by
1 for each additional squadmate who sacrifices their next action to the new
goal, as the group turns all its attention to accomplishing the goal. In
addition to reducing the difficulty, the success or failure of the roll is
carried across the whole unit, as the squad’s skills have the potential to
reshape the battlefield and win the day—or cause the squad to suffer together.
As such, stress inflicted on the squad as a whole is inflicted on each
squadmate equally.

> Rather than make a roll to try to breach an alien barrier by herself, Lara
decides to rally the Ninth Ward Defenders to knock it down together. The
difficulty of accomplishing the task falls from Fantastic (+6) to Great (+4).
If she succeeds, the whole unit will get the benefit of breaching the enemy
barrier without having to roll a second time. If she fails, the whole unit
will suffer stress from the alien counterattack.

## Squad-Based Combat

To run a great squad combat, use Operations rolls to move directly to the
heart of the action. Rather than start at the beginning of the fight—when the
conflicts are boring—get the squad to develop a plan of attack and roll
Operations as an Overcome with a difficulty appropriate to the target to see
how things turn out.

If they are successful, the players should narrate one good outcome for every
shift above the target. If they fail, the GM will narrate one negative outcome
for every shift below the target. Either way, jump straight to the exciting
action. Repeat when things start to drag in the middle of the fight.

> After breaching the alien barrier, Lara is pretty sure that her PC can get
close enough to the alien queen to kill her before the rest of the aliens
regroup. She rallies the Ninth Ward Defenders to charge the enemy line,
rolling their Fair (+2) Operations against a difficulty of Great (+4) set by
her GM. She gets a +2 on her roll, but invokes the <span class="aspect">Dogs of
War</span> to get another +2 for a total of Fantastic (+6). For her first
shift, she narrates that they charge the line successfully, and for her
second, she states that her character gets close enough to kill the queen.
