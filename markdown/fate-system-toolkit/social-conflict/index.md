#  Social Conflict

The social skills in Fate Core (Deceive, Empathy, Provoke, Rapport) already
give groups a variety of ways to approach social conflicts, but your group can
also implement a system of **motivations** and **instincts** to provide PCs
more opportunities to engage NPCs in social interactions.

## Motivations and Instincts

Any NPC—even a nameless guard—has two components to their social logic: a
motivation and an instinct that follows from that motivation. For example, a
teacher may want to safeguard his students (<span class="aspect">Motivation: Protect
His Students from Harm</span>) by keeping the players’ characters from
interrogating a particular student (<span class="aspect">Instinct: Deny the PCs
Access</span>). Any attempts to produce a change will require the PCs to
either alter the NPC’s motivation or convince them that a different instinct
better serves the motivation itself.

You might notice that most motivations double as situation aspects that can be
invoked and compelled using fate points.

Remember the Bronze Rule!

## Discovering and Modifying Motivations

Of course, motivations are sometimes difficult to detect. While some NPCs will
clearly announce why they are opposing the PCs—“I’ve come to avenge my
father!”—most people don’t run around shouting out their internal monologues
to the world. In order to discover an NPC’s motivations, the PCs need to
create advantages using an appropriate social skill. Characters can pick up on
small clues (Empathy), challenge the NPC through taunts or provocative
statements (Provoke), or even pretend to be someone the NPC can trust
(Deceive), in order to discover NPC motivations.

Once the PCs know an NPC’s motivation, they can try to alter that motivation
using a variety of social skills, replacing the motivation with a urgent
concern based on new information (Rapport) or attempting to falsely convince
the target that their motivation is based on bad assumptions (Deceive). For
example, a loyal guard (<span class="aspect">Motivation: Follow My Boss’
Orders</span>, <span class="aspect">Instinct: Kill the PCs</span>) might be scared off
by a sufficiently impressive threat (Provoke) designed to change his
motivation to <span class="aspect">Save My Own Skin</span>.

## Modifying Instincts

Rather than attempt to sway an NPC’s motivations, PCs may also create
situations that demand more immediate attention or suggest that a different
instinct would better serve the original motivation. For example, the PCs
might start a fire (Provoke) in the lobby of the hotel to distract a hotel
concierge (<span class="aspect">Motivation: Keep the Hotel Running Smoothly</span>) or
try to convince a drug lord to part with the drugs for less (Rapport) on the
promise that future shipments will make up the loss on volume
(<span class="aspect">Motivation: Make Lots of Money</span>). These attempts to change
the NPC’s instincts might move an NPC from <span class="aspect">Instinct: Keep the PCs
Out</span> to <span class="aspect">Instinct: Put Out the Fire!</span> or from
<span class="aspect">Instinct: Sell the Drugs at Market Prices</span> to
<span class="aspect">Instinct: Sell the Drugs Cheap</span>. Ultimately these social
interactions rely on the PCs’ ability to sell the new instinct as better
serving the original motivation instead of changing the original motivation
completely.

## Challenges, Contests, and Conflicts

For most attempts to modify NPC motivations or instincts, the PCs will need to
make overcome rolls against an active opposition; the NPC rolls an appropriate
social skill to see through the deception or resist the fast talk. In some
cases it may make sense to use the contest mechanics—trying to convince a
judge to let someone out of jail before the judge moves on to the next case—or
conflict mechanics—union and management representatives conducting a hard-
nosed negotiation that leaves both sides exhausted. Players should also keep
in mind that their opponents have social strengths and weaknesses: it’s easier
to convince a dim-witted, loyal guard with Average (+1) Empathy and Great (+4)
Will that his boss wants him to let you in to the secret meeting (Deceive to
modify instinct) than it is to convince him that he should abandon his boss
altogether (Rapport to modify motivation).

> Michael Romero and Amarika Davis are Los Angeles homicide detectives
investigating the murder of a wealthy socialite, Richard Bentley. After
digging through the case, they discover that Bentley’s wife, Sandra Orastin,
is the killer. Yet when they show up to arrest her, one of her security guards
keeps them from getting close enough to close the case (<span class="aspect">Instinct:
Stop the Cops from Arresting My Boss</span>).

>

> Knowing that a physical conflict would give Orastin a chance to escape,
Amarika tries to talk her way past the guard, beginning with a Provoke roll to
learn the guard’s motivation (create an advantage with Provoke). She has a
Good (+3) Provoke and rolls well (+3), bringing her total up to Fantastic
(+6). The guard, a nameless NPC with an Average (+1) Deceive, rolls decently
(+2), but can’t help but reveal his motivation: he doesn’t want to get fired
by letting his boss get arrested. The GM adds the aspect
<span class="aspect">Motivation: Keep My Job</span> with two free invocations, since
Amarika succeeded with style. Amarika asks him why he wants to protect a
killer and the guard sputters something about doing his job even though he
doesn’t like it.

>

> Michael, seizing on the aspect Amarika discovered, decides that he’s going
to try to alter the guard’s instinct. He suggests that if the guard wants to
keep his job, he should help the police arrest Orastin. After all, the guard
will definitely lose his job if Michael and Amarika have to arrest him, too.

>

> Michael has a stronger Rapport (+3) than Provoke (+1) skill, so he focuses
on convincing the guard instead of scaring him (overcome with Rapport).
Michael’s roll is average (+0), but he uses the free invocation on
<span class="aspect">Motivation: Keep My Job</span> to bring his roll up to a Superb
(+5) result. The guard, with Fair (+2) Will rolls poorly (-2), and Michael
convinces him that working with the police is the best way to fulfill his
Motivation. Michael gains an additional boost <span class="aspect">Led by the
Guards</span> for succeeding with style.
