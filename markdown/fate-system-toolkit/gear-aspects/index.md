#  Gear Aspects

In Fate, gear is in the background. Your skills take center stage when it
comes to what you can do; gear is simply there to enable you to use your
skills. Do you have a high Shoot? Then you’ve got a gun! Did you prioritize
Drive? You’ve probably got a car. These things are assumed, and have no
mechanical effect. The Extras chapter in Fate Core tells you how you can give
gear mechanical teeth, adding Weapon ratings or giving a piece of gear its own
aspects or skills. There’s a middle ground, though, one that doesn’t require
any reduction in refresh and that allows all significant gear to be
significant.

If you want to tread that middle ground, keeping gear simple and in the
background but increasing its mechanical weight, you can use **gear aspects**.
In this method, most gear behaves like it does in default Fate—it enables
skill use and provides justification for actions. However, if a piece of gear
has the potential to be significant to the story at some point, it becomes an
aspect.

A gear aspect can be as generic or as descriptive as you desire. If you’re the
sort for whom guns are important but interchangeable, maybe you just have a
<span class="aspect">Revolver</span> or a <span class="aspect">Sniper Rifle</span>. If you
want to get a little more specific, maybe it’s a <span class="aspect">Pristine Colt
.45</span> or a <span class="aspect">Silenced XM21</span>. Want to drill down even
more? Give yourself <span class="aspect">My Father’s Service Revolver</span> or
<span class="aspect">My Well-Used, Modified XM21</span>. The point is that, if it’s
important, it gets an aspect. Things like your jacket and shoes, your
sunglasses, your car keys—maybe even your car—don’t need aspects, _unless
_they become important to the story.

A gear aspect functions like any other aspect: you can invoke it, and other
people can compel it—or invoke it—against you. You can invoke a gear aspect
any time it would be useful: invoke your <span class="aspect">25 Karat Watch</span>
when you want to flash a little bling and impress someone, or invoke your
<span class="aspect">Press Pass</span> to get a little closer to that crime scene.

There’s one final rule when it comes to gear aspects, GMs—you can take them
away. If a PC is starting to rely a little too much on a piece of gear, or if
it just feels like time to shake things up, find a reason for that aspect to
go away. Doing this is a compel, so the player _can _refuse it—and that’s
fine—you don’t want to take away your players’ favorite parts of the game.
Also, getting rid of the aspect doesn’t necessarily mean that the player loses
that piece of gear permanently. A _Press Pass_ can lose its aspect when the PC
gets suspended, and a _Revolver_ can be shut down when it runs out of ammo. In
both cases, there’s a narrative way to get the aspect back, and sometimes that
can kick-start an adventure on its own!

### TOO MANY ASPECTS?

If each PC has five aspects and maybe four or five gear aspects, plus there
are scene aspects and consequences and what have you, isn’t that too many
aspects? It sure can be! Here’s a secret: gear aspects are basically portable
situation aspects. As such, they can do a lot of the heavy lifting that
situation aspects can, if you feel like there’s too much going on in a scene.
You don’t want to _eliminate _situation aspects altogether, but if each PC has
a number of gear aspects, start with fewer situation aspects.

It’s also a good idea to limit the number of gear aspects each PC has. Not
every piece of gear needs its own aspect, so limiting PCs to three, two, or
even one signature piece of gear is perfectly fine.

Finally, in a game focused on gear rather than PC relationships or previous
adventures, gear aspects might replace the [“phase trio” aspects](../../fate-core/phase-trio).
