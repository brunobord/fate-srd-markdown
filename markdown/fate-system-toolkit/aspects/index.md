#  Aspects

Aspects are what make Fate _go_. They’re the clearest, most interesting method
for describing who your character is, and they form the basis of the fate
point economy. Invoking an aspect gives you a certain amount of control over
your destiny, a way to mitigate the caprice of the dice. Compels are the GM’s
best friend when it comes to creating story and situation, injecting drama
into a scene, or just plain throwing a wrench into the players’ plans.

Fate Core gives you the basic ways to use aspects and, for most groups, those
will be enough. If you’re looking to squeeze a little more out of your
aspects, crank up the complexity, or just do something different, read on.

## Invoking for Effect

Fate Core talks a little bit about this concept, explaining that what was
previously known as “invoking for effect” is just a fancy compel. That’s true,
but maybe that’s not _all_ it means to invoke for effect.

When you invoke for effect, you’re spending a fate point—or a free
invocation—to create a specifically defined mechanical effect, something other
than what a typical aspect is capable of. When you create an aspect, look at
it and decide whether or not it needs a special effect attached to it. Maybe
your earth mage can invoke <span class="aspect">One with the Earth</span> to avoid
falling down or being moved against his will, or maybe your psychic detective
can invoke <span class="aspect">Mental Eavesdropper</span> to read someone’s surface
thoughts.

Mechanically, an aspect effect should be worth the fate point you’re
spending—the equivalent to two shifts’ worth of potency, just like any other
effect of invoking an aspect. Aspect effects should _do_ something, like in
the examples above, rather than provide a static bonus. A regular aspect
invocation already provides a bonus, so you don’t need a special effect that
does that, too. An aspect effect is a bit like having an extra rules-exception
stunt that you always have to pay for, both in terms of what the effect can
accomplish and the amount of complexity it adds to your character.

### HOW MANY EFFECTS?

Speaking of character complexity, gms need to decide how many of these effects
each player character gets. the simplest way to use this rule is to allow each
player to add a special effect to her high concept, since that’s the aspect
that’s most likely to be big and character-defining. you can give pcs more
aspect effects, but give them too many and it’s like having too many
stunts—they’re not all going to get used and the volume of choices can lead to
analysis paralysis.

NPCs can have aspect effects too, but it’s best to give them only to your main
NPCs and _maybe_ a really important supporting npc. in both cases, it’s best
to limit the number of aspect effects per character to one or two at most.

In both cases, it’s best to limit the number of aspect effects per character
to one or two at most.

In terms of cost, it’s okay for PCs to have one or even two of these effects
for free. They’re on par with a normal invocation in terms of power, and
they’re more situational so they’re less likely to be used often. GMs, more
than that and you’re within your rights to ask PCs to spend refresh on
additional effects.

**Aspect:** <span class="aspect">Always Armed</span>

**Effect**: Spend a fate point to reveal a small, concealable weapon—like a knife or a holdout pistol—secreted away on your person somewhere, even if you’ve recently been disarmed.

**Aspect:** <span class="aspect">Ninja of the Serpent Clan</span>

**Effect**: Spend a fate point to vanish from sight, even if people are looking at you. This gives you justification to make a Stealth roll to hide.

**Aspect:** <span class="aspect">Sharp-Eyed Elvish Scout</span>

**Effect**: Spend a fate point to be able to see distant things—up to a mile away—clearly and in great detail, even at night.

## Scaled Invocation

When you invoke an aspect, it provides you with a +2 bonus or a reroll. This
is fine most of the time, but it provides no mechanical advantage for invoking
aspects that apply particularly well to a situation, nor does it provide any
disincentive for invoking aspects that apply only tenuously. Another option is
scaled invocation.

Scaled invocation divides aspects into three categories—tenuous invocations,
relevant invocations, and perfect invocations.

**Tenuous invocations** only barely apply to the situation at hand, like invoking <span class="aspect">Strong Like Bull</span> in a drinking contest or using a <span class="aspect">Pile of Garbage</span> to break your fall from a second-story window. If an invocation is tenuous, you can only use it for a reroll. This means you’ll never get to use it to increase your roll beyond what you’d be able to roll on the dice, but you can use it to mitigate a truly disastrous roll. It also means that multiple tenuous invocations aren’t usually all that useful.

When you make a **relevant invocation**, you’re invoking something that
clearly applies to the current situation without requiring too much
justification. Maybe you’re using <span class="aspect">Fastest Gun in the West</span>
in a gunfight, or maybe you’re hiding behind a <span class="aspect">Concrete
Wall</span> for cover. It gives you exactly what an invocation normally
would—a +2 or a reroll.

A **perfect invocation** is one that makes everyone say “Awesome!” or smile
and nod enthusiastically when you announce it. It’s perfectly suited to the
situation, clearly the right choice in that instance. There’s little else that
might motivate your character as strongly as invoking <span class="aspect">Udru Khai
Killed My Family</span> when you’re trying to tackle him as he’s getting away.
When you invoke a perfect aspect, you _automatically succeed _on your action,
no roll necessary. If you invoke after the roll, just ignore your roll. If you
need to know how many shifts you generated, assume you generated 1. This _does
_mean you can invoke a second aspect to succeed with style, if it’s relevant.

The exception here is an attack. When you invoke a perfect aspect on an
attack, you don’t have to roll. Instead, your attack is set at your skill
rating plus 3. Thus, if you were attacking with your Good (+3) Fight and
invoked a perfect aspect, your effort would be a Fantastic (+6), which your
opponent can then defend against. If you’ve already rolled, and invoking a
perfect aspect would get you a _better _result, take your result and add 1 to
it.

## Detonating Situation Aspects

Some situation aspects imply destructibility or finite use, such as
<span class="aspect">Pallet of Propane Tanks</span> or <span class="aspect">Rotted Support
Columns</span>. They can have an effect on the narrative but not necessarily a
mechanical effect. If you’d like such aspects to be mechanically distinct from
aspects like <span class="aspect">Inky Darkness</span> or <span class="aspect">Cover
Everywhere</span>, you can allow PCs to detonate these situation aspects.

When a player detonates a situation aspect, he declares his intent to do so
and explains how he’s using that aspect such that no one will be able to use
it again. If he can do this to everyone’s satisfaction, he gets to invoke the
aspect once for free.

Once he’s done invoking the aspect, it goes away and the situation changes for
the worse—or at least the more dangerous. Detonating an aspect creates a new
situation aspect, which represents how the old aspect was destroyed, and how
it wrecked things. That last bit is the key—it has to wreck things, to
complicate things. It’s no fair to detonate that <span class="aspect">Pallet of
Propane Tanks</span> and replace it with something boring like
<span class="aspect">Scorch Marks</span>. Replace it with something big and flashy and
destructive, like <span class="aspect">The Building Is on Fire!</span> or
<span class="aspect">The Ceiling Is Collapsing!</span>. The new situation aspect must
always make things more tenuous for _everyone_, and should always be an
imminent threat.
