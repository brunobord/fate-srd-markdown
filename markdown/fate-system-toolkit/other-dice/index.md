#  Other Dice

Don’t have your Fate dice or Deck of Fate handy? Here are some alternatives to
get your game going.

## D6-D6

Take two six-sided dice of different colors. Designate one as the positive die
and the other as the negative, and roll. Subtract the negative from the
positive to get a result of -5 to +5. Doubles are always a zero. It’s
“swingier” than four Fate dice, and the range is broader, but it’s close
enough for jazz.

## Connect the Dots

This technique was first seen in “Baby’s First Fudge Dice” by Jonathan Walton.
You can Google up a more extensive explanation of the idea—look for the link
that leads to sinisterforces.com.

With a permanent marker and some pipped six-sided dice, you can make your
_own_ Fate dice by connecting the dots. The 2 and 3 sides become your
<span class="fate_font">-</span> sides, the 4 and 6 sides become your
<span class="fate_font">0</span> sides, and the 5 and 1 sides become your
<span class="fate_font">+</span> sides—you’ll have to freehand the 1. Ta-da—artisanal
Fate dice!

## 3d6

If you go in for tables, or if you just have a good memory, you can roll three
six-sided dice.

3| 4| 5-6| 7-8| 9-12| 13-14| 15-16| 17| 18  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
-4| -3| -2| -1| +0| +1| +2| +3| +4  
  
## 4d6

This one’s the least work, but maybe not the most intuitive: roll four six-
sided dice and treat 1s and 2s as <span class="fate_font">-</span>, 3s and 4s as
<span class="fate_font">0</span>, and 5s and 6s as <span class="fate_font">+</span>.
