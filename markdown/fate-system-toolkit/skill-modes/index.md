#  Skill Modes

A **skill mode** is a bundle of several skills that represents a broad area of
competence. Modes are great for speeding up character creation even more than
Fate Core already does. Instead of picking and rating 10 individual skills,
players pick and rate three modes, and the skills come along for the ride.

Take a look at your game’s skill list and think about archetypes you’d like to
see in your setting. For each of these archetypes, choose five or six relevant
skills. Each of these skill groups is a mode. It’s okay if some skills show up
in more than one mode, but if any are so common that they’re in nearly every
mode, be aware that it’s going to lead to a certain sameness between
characters.

Ideally, you want between four and eight modes—enough for variety, but few
enough that picking three is still fast.

> Ben is planning a classic fantasy game of dungeon-delving, treasure-
grabbing, and the occasional dragon-slaying. This game’s skills are Athletics,
Burglary, Contacts, Deceit, Empathy, Intimidation, Melee, Missile, Physique,
Rapport, Stealth, Survival, and Will. Based on that list, he comes up with
four modes:

>

> Battle| Talk| Thievery| Woodcraft  
> ---|---|---|---  
> Athletics| Contacts| Athletics| Athletics  
> Intimidation| Deceit| Burglary| Lore  
> Melee| Empathy| Deceit| Notice  
> Missile| Rapport| Notice| Stealth  
> Physique| Will| Stealth| Survival  
>  
> Ben notices that Athletics shows up in three of the four, but it’s such a
broadly applicable skill that he can’t imagine any of those modes doing
without it, either. Besides, the tomb-robber PCs are going to need it.

## Ratings

The usual Fate Core skill pyramid doesn’t apply to skills in modes. Instead,
each player picks three modes and rates them—one at Good (+3), one at Fair
(+2), and one at Average (+1)—and the mode’s rating becomes the default rating
for all of its skills. Skills at this rating are **trained**. Skills one step
above their mode’s level are **focused**, and skills two steps above are
**specialized**.

> One of Ben’s players, Will, wants to play a thief-type, so he picks Good
(+3) Thievery. This means Athletics, Burglary, Deceit, Notice, and Stealth all
start out trained, with a rating of Good (+3).

## Reinforced Skills

If two or three of a character’s modes contain the same skill, it’s
**reinforced**. When this happens, write it down under its highest-rated mode,
but not under any other. No skill should appear more than once on a character
sheet.

If a skill is reinforced once—meaning it’s shared by two modes—improve it from
trained to focused. If it’s reinforced twice—shared by all three modes—improve
it from trained to specialized.

> In addition to his Good (+3) Thievery, Will’s also picked Fair (+2) Talk and
Average (+1) Battle. Both Battle and Thievery have Athletics, so it goes from
trained to focused—from Good (+3) to Great (+4) under Thievery. Likewise, Talk
and Thievery share Deceit, so that skill’s also focused under Thievery. So
far, Will’s modes look like this:

>

> | Good (+3)Thievery| Fair (+2) Talk| Average (+1) Battle  
> ---|---|---|---  
> +5|  |  |  
> +4| Athletics, Deceit|  |  
> +3| Burglary, Notice, Stealth|  |  
> +2|  | Contacts, Empathy, Rapport, Will|  
> +1|  |  | Intimidation, Melee, Missile, Physique  
  
## Improving Skills

After that, each player has 7 points to further improve skills.

Improvement| Cost  
---|---  
Focus a trained skill| 1  
Specialize a focused skill| 2  
Specialize a trained skill| 3  
  
No skill can ever be improved beyond specialized.

> Will wants to be especially sneaky, so he spends 3 points to specialize
Stealth, from Good (+3) to Superb (+5). He’d also like to be capable in
combat, so he spends another 3 to specialize Melee as well, from Average (+1)
to Good (+3). With his last point, he focuses Contacts, from Fair (+2) to Good
(+3), so he can be a little better connected.

>

> | Good (+3) Thievery| Fair (+2) Talk| Average (+1) Battle  
> ---|---|---|---  
> +5| Stealth|  |  
> +4| Athletics, Deceit|  |  
> +3| Burglary, Notice| Contacts| Melee  
> +2|  | Empathy, Rapport, Will|  
> +1|  |  | Intimidation, Missile, Physique  
  
## Modes with Extras

Some modes offer access to **extras**—either because it contains a skill
extra, or because it unlocks an aspect extra. For each such extra associated
with a mode, the mode has one fewer skill than normal. For example, if
standard modes in your game have five skills, a mode with a skill extra would
have only four. Aspect extras are in addition to the usual number of aspects
for your game.

> Ben adds four modes to his list: Arcana and The Gods, for two different
kinds of magic, and Dwarf and Elf, for…dwarves and elves. The first two have
two extras each—a skill and an aspect, both related to magic—and the second
two only have one—an aspect.

>

> Arcana| The Gods| Dwarf| Elf  
> ---|---|---|---  
> Lore| Favor| Intimidation| Athletics  
> Magic| Lore| Lore| Lore  
> Will| Will| Melee| Missile  
> _Skill Extra_| _Skill Extra_| Physique| Notice  
> _Aspect Extra_| _Aspect Extra_| _Aspect Extra_| _Aspect Extra_
