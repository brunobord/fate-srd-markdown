#  The Bronze Rule

There’s one more thing you should ask yourself before you make an entirely new
rule for something—can I represent this with the [Bronze Rule](../..
/fate-core/extras#the-bronze-rule-aka-the-fate-fractal)?

In Fate, you can treat pretty much anything as if it were a character. Your
gun? Sure. The storm outside? Absolutely. The scene itself? Why not? You can
give anything aspects, skills, stunts, and stress boxes, and here’s the thing
that makes this technique really cool—they don’t have to be the same ones the
PCs get. It doesn’t make sense for the storm outside to have Fight and
Physique, but what about Cold and Sleet? Your gun doesn’t need a physical or
mental stress track, but what about an ammo stress track? And scenes already
have aspects all over the place!

If you can represent a new thing as a character, it’s typically easier to do
that than to create a new rule out of whole cloth. Not _everything_ works this
way, and there are some things you might not want to represent this way, but
it’s a powerful tool that you can apply to a wide variety of situations.

There’s another extension of this technique—new rules for characters can be
represented using the existing components of a character. You can represent
magic through skills, super powers using aspects or stunts, and being
corrupted by an ancient and seductive force with a stress track.
