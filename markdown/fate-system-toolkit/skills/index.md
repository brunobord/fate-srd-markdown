#  Skills

## Change That List!

The skills in Fate Core are designed to offer a wide range of actions, broadly
applicable to a number of different settings. That said, the skill list is the
thing we expect you to change first. Your skill list should be rooted in your
setting and should reinforce it; if the default skill list works for this,
you’re in luck! In some cases it might _mostly _work for you, but you might
have to add a skill or two, take one out, or rename a few. If you’re looking
to make more extensive modifications to the skill list—or even the system
itself—then this chapter is for you.
