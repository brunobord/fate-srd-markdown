#  Variations and Options

## Deeper Understanding

Perhaps each Storm also has a corresponding Calm—Blaze, Mountain, Sea,
Snowfall, and Wind. Some who have mastered a Storm may in time gain another
aspect—costing 1 refresh—to reflect that Calm, which will allow them to
internalize the strengths of the Storm to enhance themselves in a variety of
ways as well as generate more subtle effects.

## Multiple Storms

Nothing prohibits a Caller from attuning to multiple Storms; it simply costs
one refresh for each aspect he takes.

## Ritual Magic

It is possible to have the Stormcaller skill but no attunement to a storm.
This is the status of many hedge practitioners. The advantage to this is that
they may work with whatever storm they wish. The downside is that it takes a
few minutes to do what a true Stormcaller can do in a single exchange.

## Summonings

The Storms are not empty spaces. Beings native to each storm swim within them
comfortably, and can be summoned to serve those who know how to call. See the
[Storm Summoners](../../fate-system-toolkit/storm-summoners) system
for an exploration of this.

## Light and Dark Callers

Those who study such things suggest that there is an arc to the great Storms.
Born of almost pure energy (Thunder), they coalesce (Inferno) and thicken
(Flood) before hardening (Glacier) into something concrete (Earthquake). Or
perhaps it is the reverse, beginning with base matter and ascending toward
energy. In either case, it is theorized that there exist a sixth and seventh
“Storm,” bookending the great Storms. Energy and Light at one end, with Stasis
and Darkness at the other. There have been those who have claimed to tap these
forces in a fashion similar to the storms, but they are a rarity, and much of
their effort has been spent in conflict with one another over the question of
which is the beginning and which is the end.

## Voidcallers

For all their destructive fury, the Storms are part of reality, for they are
both destruction and creation. On a cosmic level, they stand against the Void,
the nothingness that seeks to consume all. Light- and Darkcallers tend to
characterize their opposite in this manner, and there’s no telling what truth
there is or isn’t to it. The Void is a force for destruction, and while it may
not be malicious, those who dwell in it are, for it is the home to demons and
monsters that would like nothing more than to consume the Storms, and with
them, our world. See the [Voidcallers](../../fate-system-
toolkit/voidcallers) section for more ideas on this.
