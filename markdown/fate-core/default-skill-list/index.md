#  Default Skill List

Here is a basic list of example skills for you to use in your Fate games along
with example stunts tied to each. They’re the ones being used for all the
examples in this book, and should give you a good foundation from which to
tweak your own lists, adding and subtracting skills as best fits your setting.
For more on creating your own skills, see the [Extras](../../fate-
core/extras "Extras" ) section.

Each skill description contains a list of game actions that you can use the
skill for. This list is not necessarily exhaustive—see our guidelines for what
to do with [edge cases](../../fate-core/what-do-during-play).

### Creating Setting With Skills

Skills are one of your primary mechanical ways to reinforce the setting you’re
using or creating for your game. The skills provided in this list are
deliberately generic so that they can be used in a variety of settings, and
the stunts provided continue this trend by not being tied to any particular
setting.

When you’re creating your own setting for use with Fate, you should also
create your own skill list. The default list provided is a good starting
point, but creating skills specific to your world can help make it seem richer
by reinforcing the story with mechanics. Stunts, too, should reflect the kinds
of abilities available in your world.

### Skills and Gear

Some of the skills, like Shoot and Crafts, imply the need for gear. It is
presumed by default that if you have a skill, you also have the tools you need
to use it, and that the effectiveness of those tools is built into the skill
result. If you want to make gear special, you’ll want to look at the [Extras
](../../fate-core/extras) section.
