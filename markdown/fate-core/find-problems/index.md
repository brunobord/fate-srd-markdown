#  Find Problems

Creating a scenario begins with finding a problem for the PCs to deal with. A
good problem is **relevant to the PCs, cannot be resolved without their
involvement, and cannot be ignored without dire consequences.**

That may seem like a tall order. Fortunately, you have a great storytelling
tool to help you figure out appropriate problems for your game: aspects.

Your PCs’ aspects have a lot of story built into them—they’re an indication of
what’s important about (and to) each character, they indicate what things in
the game world the PCs are connected to, and they describe the unique facets
of each character’s identity.

You also have the aspects that are attached to your game—all your current and
impending issues, location aspects, and any aspects you’ve put on any of your
campaign’s faces. Riffing off of those helps to reinforce the sense of a
consistent, dynamic world, and keep your game’s central premise in the
forefront of play.

Because of all these aspects, you already have a ton of story potential
sitting right in front of you—now, you just have to unlock it.

You can look at an aspect-related problem as a very large-scale kind of [event
compel](../../fate-core/invoking-compelling-aspects "Invoking &
Compelling Aspects" ). The setup is a little more work, but the structure is
similar—having an aspect suggests or implies something problematic for the PC
or multiple PCs, but unlike a compel, it’s something they can’t easily resolve
or deal with in the moment.

### You Don't Always Have To Destroy The World

As you will see from the examples, not all of our urgent, consequential
problems necessarily involve the fate of the world or even a large portion of
the setting. Interpersonal problems can have just as much of an impact on a
group of PCs as stopping this week’s bad guy—winning someone’s respect or
resolving an ongoing dispute between two characters can just as easily take
the focus for a scenario as whatever grand scheme your badass villain is
cooking up.

If you want a classic action-adventure story setup, see if you can come up
with two main problems for your scenario—one that focuses on something
external to the characters (like the villain’s scheme), and one that deals
with interpersonal issues. The latter will serve as a subplot in your scenario
and give the characters some development time while they’re in the midst of
dealing with other problems.

## Problems and Character Aspects

When you’re trying to get a problem from a character aspect, try fitting it
into this sentence:

  * You have ____ aspect, which implies ____ (and this may be a list of things, by the way). Because of that, ____ would probably be a big problem for you.

The second blank is what makes this a little harder than an event compel—you
have to think about all the different potential implications of an aspect.
Here are some questions to help with that.

  * Who might have a problem with the character because of this aspect?
  * Does the aspect point to a potential threat to that character?
  * Does the aspect describe a connection or relationship that could cause trouble for the character?
  * Does the aspect speak to a backstory element that could come back to haunt the character?
  * Does the aspect describe something or someone important to the character that you can threaten?

As long as whatever you put in the third blank fits the criteria at the
beginning of this section, you’re good to go.

> Cynere has <span class="aspect">Infamous Girl With Sword</span>, which implies that
her reputation precedes her across the countryside. Because of that, a copycat
committing crimes in her name and getting the inhabitants of the next city she
visits angry and murderous would probably be a big problem for her.

>

> Landon has an aspect of <span class="aspect">I Owe Old Finn Everything</span>, which
implies that he’d feel obligated to help Finn out with any personal problems.
Because of that, having to bail Finn’s son out of a gambling debt he owes to
some very nasty people would probably be a big problem for him.

>

> Zird has <span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia Arcana</span>, which implies
that some or many of them are scheming against him constantly. Because of
that, a series of concentrated assassination attempts from someone or several
people who know how to get past all his magical defenses would probably be a
big problem for him.

## Problems and Game Aspects

Problems you get from a game’s current and impending issues will be a little
wider in scope than character-driven problems, affecting all your PCs and
possibly a significant number of NPCs as well. They’re less personal, but that
doesn’t mean they have to be less compelling (pardon the pun).

  * Because ____ is an issue, it implies ____. Therefore, ____ would probably create a big problem for the PCs.

Ask yourself:

  * What threats does the issue present to the PCs?
  * Who are the driving forces behind the issue, and what messed up thing might they be willing to do to advance their agenda?
  * Who else cares about dealing with the issue, and how might their “solution” be bad for the PCs?
  * What’s a good next step for resolving the issue, and what makes accomplishing that step hard?

### Put A Face On It

While not all of your scenario problems have to be directly caused by an NPC
who serves as a “master villain” for the PCs to take down, it’s often easier
if they are. At the very least, you should be able to point directly to an NPC
who benefits a great deal from the scenario problem not going the way the PCs
want it to go.

> Because <span class="aspect">The Scar Triad</span> is an issue, it implies that the
Triad is making a serious power play across the land. Therefore, a complete
government takeover by Triad members in the city they’re sent to on their next
job would probably create a big problem for the PCs.

>

> Because <span class="aspect">The Doom that Is to Come</span> is an issue, it implies
that agents of the Cult of Tranquility are constantly trying to fulfill parts
of the ancient prophecies that foretell the doom. Therefore, a series of
ritual murders in the next town meant to awaken an ancient demon that sleeps
under the town would probably create a big problem for the PCs.

>

> Because the Cult of Tranquility’s <span class="aspect">Two Conflicting
Prophecies</span> is an issue, it implies that there’s an internal Cult
struggle to validate one prophecy as being definitive. Therefore, an all-out
war between rival factions in the next town that brings innocents into the
crossfire would probably create a big problem for the PCs.

## Problems and Aspect Pairs

This is where you really start cooking with gas. You can also create problems
from the relationship between two aspects instead of relying on just one. That
lets you keep things personal, but broaden the scope of your problem to impact
multiple characters, or thread a particular PC’s story into the story of the
game.

There are two main forms of aspect pairing: connecting two character aspects,
and connecting a character aspect to an issue.

### Two Character Aspects

  * Because ____ has ____ aspect and ____ has ____ aspect, it implies that ____. Therefore, ____ would probably be a big problem for them.

Ask yourself:

  * Do the two aspects put those characters at odds or suggest a point of tension between them?
  * Is there a particular kind of problem or trouble that both would be likely to get into because of the aspects?
  * Does one character have a relationship or a connection that could become problematic for the other?
  * Do the aspects point to backstory elements that can intersect in the present?
  * Is there a way for one PC’s fortune to become another’s misfortune, because of the aspects?

> Because Landon is a <span class="aspect">Disciple of the Ivory Shroud</span>, and
Zird has <span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia Arcana</span>, it implies that
both factions could occasionally cross paths and have incompatible agendas.
Therefore, a mandate from the monks of a local Shroud monastery to capture or
kill the members of a local Collegia chapterhouse for an unknown slight would
probably be a big problem for them.

>

> Because Cynere is <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny Things</span>, and Landon
has <span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat</span>, it implies that they’re
probably the worst partners for any kind of undercover heist. Therefore, a
contract to infiltrate the Royal Ball of Ictherya with no backup and walk out
with the Crown Jewels on behalf of a neighboring kingdom would probably be a
big problem for them.

>

> Because Zird has <span class="aspect">If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve Read About
It</span>, and Cynere is the <span class="aspect">Secret Sister of Barathar</span>, it
implies that proof of Cynere’s true heritage could one day fall into Zird’s
hands. Therefore, the unexpected arrival of a genealogical document in code
that Barathar and her henchies seek to recover at all costs would probably be
a big problem for them.

### Character Aspect and Issue

  * Because you have ____ aspect and ____ is an issue, it implies that ____. Therefore, ____ would probably be a big problem for you.

Ask yourself:

  * Does the issue suggest a threat to any of the PC’s relationships?
  * Is the next step to dealing with the issue something that impacts a particular character personally because of their aspects?
  * Does someone connected to the issue have a particular reason to target the PC because of an aspect?

### How Many Problems Do I Need

For a single scenario, one or two is sufficient, trust us. You’ll see below
that even one problem can create enough material for two or three sessions.
Don’t feel like you have to engage every PC with every scenario—rotate the
spotlight around a little so that they each get some spotlight time, and then
throw in an issue-related scenario when you want to concentrate on the larger
“plot” of the game.

> Because Cynere is the <span class="aspect">Secret Sister of Barathar</span> and
<span class="aspect">The Scar Triad</span> is an issue, it implies that the Triad
could have leverage over Cynere for blackmail. Therefore, the Triad hiring her
for an extremely dangerous and morally reprehensible job on the threat of
revealing her secret to the world and making her a public enemy across the
land would probably be a big problem for her.

>

> Because Zird has <span class="aspect">If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve Read About
It</span>, and the Cult of Tranquility’s <span class="aspect">Two Conflicting
Prophecies</span> are an issue, it implies that Zird could be the key to
figuring out which of the prophecies is legitimate. Therefore, getting
approached by the Primarch to learn the Rites of Tranquility and figure out
the truth of the prophecy, and thus becoming a target for manipulation from
both major factions, would probably be a big problem for him.

>

> Because Landon has <span class="aspect">An Eye for an Eye</span>, and
<span class="aspect">The Doom that Is to Come</span> is an issue, it implies that
anything the Cult does to Landon’s loved ones would be met with a desire for
vengeance. Therefore, an attack on his hometown by Cult agents on the prowl
for more indoctrinated servants as preparation for the End Times would
probably be a big problem for him.
