#  Burglary

The Burglary skill covers your character’s aptitude for stealing things and
getting into places that are off-limits.

In genres that rely on the use of a lot of technology, this skill also
includes a proficiency in the related tech, allowing the character to hack
security systems, disable alarm systems, and whatnot.

<span class="fate_font">O</span>**Overcome**: As stated above, Burglary allows you to
overcome any obstacle related to theft or infiltration. Bypassing locks and
traps, pickpocketing and filching, covering your tracks, and other such
activities all fall under the purview of this skill.

<span class="fate_font">C</span>**Create an Advantage**: You can case a location with
Burglary, to determine how hard it will be to break into and what kind of
security you’re dealing with, as well as discover any vulnerabilities you
might exploit. You can also examine the work of other burglars to determine
how a particular heist was done, and create or discover aspects related to
whatever evidence they may have left behind.

<span class="fate_font">A</span>**Attack**: Burglary isn’t used for attacks.

<span class="fate_font">D</span>**Defend**: Same here. It’s not really a conflict
skill, so there’s not a lot of opportunity to use it to defend

## Burglary Stunts

  * **Always a Way Out**. +2 on Burglary rolls made to create an advantage whenever you’re trying to escape from a location.
  * **Security Specialist**. You don’t have to be present to provide active opposition to someone trying to overcome security measures you put in place or worked on. (Normally, a character would roll against passive opposition for that.)
  * **Talk the Talk**. You can use Burglary in place of Contacts whenever you’re dealing specifically with other thieves and burglars.
