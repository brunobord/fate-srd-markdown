#  What Aspects Do

In Fate, aspects do two major things: **they tell you what’s important about
the game, and they help you decide when to use the mechanics.**

## Importance

Your collection of game and character aspects tell you what you need to focus
on during your game. Think of them as a message from yourself to yourself, a
set of flags waving you towards the path with the most fun.

GMs, when you make scenarios for Fate, you’re going to use those aspects, and
the connections between aspects, to generate the problems your PCs are going
to solve. Players, your aspects are the reason why your PC stands out from
every other character who might have similar skills—lots of Fate characters
might have a high [Fight](../../fate-core/fight) skill, but only
Landon is a <span class="aspect">Disciple of the Ivory Shroud</span>. When his path as
a disciple comes into play, or the Ivory Shroud takes action, it gives the
game a personal touch that it wouldn’t have had otherwise.

The game aspects do something similar on a larger scale—they tell us why to
care about playing this particular game in the first place, what makes it
concrete and compelling to us. Everyone can all say, “Oh, we like space opera
games,” but until the group drills down to the specifics of a universe where
people will do <span class="aspect">Anything for Survival</span>, and where
<span class="aspect">The Empire is Everywhere</span>, they don’t really have anything
to attach their interest to.

Situation aspects make the moment-to-moment interactions of play interesting
by adding color and depth to what might otherwise be a boring scene. A fight
in a tavern is generic by nature—it could be any tavern, anywhere. But when
you add the aspect <span class="aspect">Huge Bronze Devil Statue</span> to the scene,
and people bring it into play, it becomes “that fight we were in at the Bronze
Devil, when I smashed that guy’s head into the statue.” The unique details add
interest and investment.

## Deciding When to Use Mechanics

Because aspects tell us what’s important, they also tell us when it’s most
appropriate to use the mechanics to deal with a situation, rather than just
letting people decide what happens just by describing what they do.

GMs, this comes up for you most often when you’re trying to figure out whether
to require a player to roll dice. If a player says, “I climb this ladder and
grab the idol,” and there’s nothing special about the ladder or the idol, then
there’s no real reason to require an overcome action to grab it. But if the
situation aspects tell you that the ladder is a <span class="aspect">Rotting Rope
Ladder</span> and the idol is <span class="aspect">Protected by the Wrath of the
Gods</span>, then you suddenly have an element of pressure and risk that makes
it worth going to the dice for.

Players, this comes up for you most often when invoking your aspects and
considering compels. Your aspects highlight what makes your character an
individual, and you want to play that up, right? So when the opportunity comes
up to make your character more awesome by invoking, go for it! When you see an
opportunity to influence the story by suggesting a compel for your character,
do it! The game will be much richer for it as a whole.
