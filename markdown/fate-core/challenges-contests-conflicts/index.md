#  Challenges, Contests, &amp; Conflicts

## Zooming In On The Action

Most of the time, a single skill roll should be enough to decide how a
particular situation in play resolves. You’re not obligated to describe
actions in a particular timeframe or level of detail when you use a skill.
Therefore, you could use a single Athletics roll to find out whether you can
safely navigate a rock face that will take days to climb, or use that same
single skill roll to find out whether you can safely avoid a swiftly falling
tree that’s about to crush you.

Sometimes, however, you’ll be in a situation where you’re doing something
really dramatic and interesting, like pivotal set pieces in a movie or a book.
When that happens, it’s a good idea to zoom in on the action and deal with it
using multiple skill rolls, because the wide range of dice results will make
things really dynamic and surprising. Most fight scenes fall into this
category, but you can zoom in on anything that you consider sufficiently
important—car chases, court trials, high-stakes poker games, and so on.

We have three ways for you to zoom in on the action in Fate:

  * [Challenges](../../fate-core/challenges), when one or more characters try to achieve something dynamic or complicated
  * [Contests](../../fate-core/contests), when two or more characters are competing for a goal
  * [Conflicts](../../fate-core/conflicts), when two or more characters are trying to directly harm each other
