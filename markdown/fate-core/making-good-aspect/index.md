#  Making A Good Aspect

Because aspects are so important to the game, it’s important to make the best
aspects you can. So, how do you know what a good aspect is?

The best aspects are **double-edged, say more than one thing, and keep the
phrasing simple.**

## Double-Edged

Players, good aspects offer a clear benefit to your character while also
providing opportunities to complicate their lives or be used to their
detriment.

An aspect with a double-edge is going to come up in play more often than a
mostly positive or negative one. You can use them frequently to be awesome,
and you’ll be able to accept more compels and gain more fate points.

Try this as a litmus test—list two ways you might invoke the aspect, and two
ways someone else could invoke it or you could get a compel from it. If the
examples come easily to mind, great! If not, add more context to make that
aspect work or put that idea to the side and come up with a new aspect.

> Let’s look at an aspect like <span class="aspect">Computer Genius</span>. The
benefits of having this aspect are pretty obvious—any time you’re hacking or
working with technology, you could justify invoking it. But it doesn’t seem
like there’s a lot of room for that aspect to work against you. So, let’s
think of a way we can spice that up a bit.

>

> What if we change that aspect to <span class="aspect">Nerdy McNerdson</span>? That
still carries the connotations that would allow you to take advantage of it
while working with computers, but it adds a downside—you’re awkward around
people. This might mean that you could accept compels to mangle a social
situation, or someone might invoke your aspect when a fascinating piece of
equipment distracts you.

GMs, this is just as true of your game and situation aspects. Any feature of a
scene you call out should be something that either the PCs or their foes could
use in a dramatic fashion. Your game aspects do present problems, but they
also should present ways for the PCs to take advantage of the status quo.

## Say More Than One Thing

Earlier, it was noted several things that a [character aspect](../..
/fate-core/aspects-fate-points "Aspects" ) might describe: personality traits,
backgrounds, relationships, problems, possessions, and so forth. The best
aspects overlap across a few of those categories, because that means you have
more ways to bring them into play.

> Let’s look at a simple aspect that a soldier might have: <span class="aspect">I Must
Prove Myself</span>. You can invoke this whenever you’re trying to do
something to gain the approval of others or demonstrate your competence.
Someone might compel it to bait you into getting into a fight you want to
avoid, or to accept a hardship for the sake of reputation. So we know it has a
double edge, so far so good.

>

> That’ll work for a bit, but eventually this aspect will run out of steam. It
says just one thing about the character. Either you’re trying to prove
yourself, or this aspect isn’t going to come up.

>

> Now tie that aspect in with a relationship to an organization:
<span class="aspect">The Legion Demands I Prove Myself</span>. Your options open up a
great deal. Not only do you get all the content from before, but you’ve
introduced that the Legion can make demands of you, can get you into trouble
by doing things you get blamed for, or can send NPC superiors to make your
life difficult. You can also invoke the aspect when dealing with the Legion,
or with anyone else who might be affected by the Legion’s reputation.
Suddenly, that aspect has a lot more going on around it.

GMs, for your situation aspects, you don’t have to worry about this as much,
because they’re only intended to stick around for a scene. It’s much more
important for game and character aspects to suggest multiple contexts for use.

* ~~<span class="aspect">I Must Prove Myself</span>~~

* <span class="aspect">The Legion Demands I Prove Myself</span>

## Clear Phrasing

Because aspects are phrases, they come with all the ambiguities of language.
If no one knows what your aspect means, it won’t get used enough.

That isn’t to say you have to avoid poetic or fanciful expression.
<span class="aspect">Just a Simple Farmboy</span> isn’t quite as fetching as
<span class="aspect">Child of Pastoral Bliss</span>. If that’s the tone your game is
going for, feel free to indulge your linguistic desires.

However, don’t do this at the expense of clarity. Avoid metaphors and
implications, when you can get away with just saying what you mean. That way,
other people don’t have to stop and ask you during play if a certain aspect
would apply, or get bogged down in discussions about what it means.

> Let’s look at <span class="aspect">Memories, Wishes, and Regrets</span>. There’s
something evocative about the phrase. It suggests a kind of melancholy about
the past. But as an aspect, I don’t really know what it’s supposed to do. How
does it help you? What are the memories of? What did you wish for? Without
some concrete idea of what the aspect’s referring to, invoking and compelling
it is pretty much impossible.

>

> Suppose we talk about this some, and you specify that you were going for
this idea that your character was scarred from years spent in the setting’s
last great war. You killed people you didn’t want to kill, saw things you
didn’t want to see, and pretty much had all your hope of returning to a normal
life taken away.

>

> I think this is all fantastic, and I suggest we call it <span class="aspect">Scars
from the War</span>. Less poetic, maybe, but it directly references all the
stuff you’re talking about, and gives me ideas about people from your past I
may be able to bring back into your life.

If you’re wondering if your aspect is unclear, ask the people at the table
what they think it means.

* ~~<span class="aspect">Memories, Wishes, and Regrets</span>~~

* <span class="aspect">Scars from the War</span>

## If You Get Stuck

Now you know what makes for a good aspect, but that doesn’t narrow down your
potential choices any—you still have a nearly infinite set of topics and ideas
to choose from.

If you’re still stuck about what to choose, here are some tips to make things
a little easier on you.

### Sometimes, It’s Better Not to Choose

If you can’t think of an aspect that really grabs you and the other people at
the table, you’re better off leaving that space blank, or just keeping
whatever ideas you had scribbled in the margins. Sometimes it’s much easier to
wait for your character to get into play before you figure out how you want to
word a particular aspect.

So when in doubt, leave it blank. Maybe you have a general idea of the aspect
but don’t know how to phrase it, or maybe you just have no idea. Don’t worry
about it. There’s always room during the game to figure it out as you go.

The same thing is true if you have more than one idea that seems juicy, but
they don’t work together and you don’t know which one to pick. Write them all
down in the margins and see which one seems to really sing in play. Then fill
the space in later, with the one that gets the most mileage.

### Always Ask What Matters and Why

It was said above that aspects tell you why something matters in the game and
why someone should care about it. This is your primary compass and guide to
choosing the best possible aspect. When in doubt, always ask: what do we
really care about here, and why?

The events of the [phases](../../fate-core/phase-trio "Phase Trio" )
should help you figure out what your aspect should be. Don’t try to summarize
the events of the phase or anything like that with your aspect—remember, the
point is to reveal something important about the character. Again, ask
yourself what really matters about the phase:

  * What was the outcome? Is that important?
  * Did the character develop any important relationships or connections during this phase?
  * Does the phase help establish anything important about the character’s personality or beliefs?
  * Did the phase give the character a reputation?
  * Did the phase create a problem for the character in the game world?

Assume that each question ends with “for good or ill”—these features,
relationships, and reputations aren’t necessarily going to be positive, after
all. Developing a relationship with a nemesis is as juicy as developing one
with your best friend.

If there’s more than one option, poll the other players and GM to see what
they find interesting. Remember, you should all be helping each other out—the
game works best if everyone’s a fan of what everyone else is doing.

> During Cynere’s [phase three](../../fate-core/phase-trio), Lily
states that she complicated Zird’s story by showing up at an opportune moment
and stealing the artifact that Zird stole from his rivals. Eventually the
artifact returns to Zird’s hands.

>

> She’s trying to tease out what the best aspect would be, and she doesn’t
have a whole lot of information to go on. Going through the questions above,
we see a lot of potential options—she showed off her underhandedness, she
definitely suggested a relationship with Zird of some kind, and Zird’s rivals
might now have a beef with her as well.

>

> Lily polls the rest of the group, and after some talking, everyone seems to
be pretty enthused about Cynere having some kind of aspected connection to
Zird—they did all grow up in the same village, after all. She decides on
<span class="aspect">I’ve Got Zird’s Back</span>, because it’s specific enough to be
invoked and compelled, but leaves room for development later on in the game.

## Vary It Up

You don’t want all your aspects to describe the same kind of thing. Five
relationships means that you can’t use your aspects unless one of them is in
play, but five personality traits means that you have no connection to the
game world. If you’re stuck on what to pick for an aspect, looking at what
kinds of things your other aspects describe may help you figure out which way
to go for the current phase.

> Lenny ends up with <span class="aspect">Disciple of the Ivory Shroud</span> and
<span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat</span> as Landon’s high concept and
trouble. So far, this is a pretty straightforward character—a violent type
whose mouth and demeanor are always getting him into trouble.

>

> Lenny does his [phase one](../../fate-core/phase-trio) and explains
to us that Landon was a miscreant and street rat that grew up practically as
an orphan—his parents were around, but never really paid too much attention to
him or spent effort reining him in. He eventually decided to enlist in the
town militia after someone saved him from a clobbering in a bar fight and
suggested he do something worthwhile with his life.

>

> Amanda asks him what really matters about this phase, and Lenny ponders a
bit. Landon’s first two aspects are heavy on personal description—he doesn’t
have a lot of relationships yet. So Lenny focuses on that and decides he wants
a connection to the guy who pulled him into the militia.

>

> They end up naming that guy Old Finn, Landon ends up with the aspect
<span class="aspect">I Owe Old Finn Everything</span>, and Amanda now has a new NPC to
play with.

## Let Your Friends Decide

The game works best if everyone is invested in what everyone else is
doing—collaboration is at the heart of the game, and it'll probably be said a
lot more throughout this site.

You always have the option, especially with aspects, of simply asking the GM
and other players to come up with something on your behalf. Pitch them the
events of the phase, and ask them the same questions they’re going to be
asking of you. What matters to them? What are they excited about? Do they have
suggestions about how to make the events of the phase more dramatic or
intense? What aspect do they think would be most interesting or appropriate?

You have the final decision as to what your character’s aspects are, so don’t
look at it as giving up control. Look at it as asking your ever-important fan
club and audience what they want to see, and using their suggestions to
jumpstart your own train of thought. If everyone has a bit of input on
everyone else’s characters, the game will benefit from that sense of mutual
investment.
