#  Your Character Idea

## **Come up with your character’s high concept and trouble aspects.**

Character creation starts with a concept for your character. It could be
modeled after a character from a favorite novel or movie, or it could be based
around some specific thing that you want to be able to do (like break boards
with your head, turn into a wolf, blow things up, etc.). Just like you did
with the game’s issues earlier, you’re going to take your ideas and turn them
into the two central aspects for your character—**high concept** and
**trouble**.

Player characters should be exceptional and interesting. They could very
easily find success in less exciting situations than those that come their way
in play. You must figure out why your character is going to keep getting
involved in these more dangerous things. If you don’t, the GM is under no
obligation to go out of her way to make the game work for you—she’ll be too
busy with other players who made characters that have a reason to participate.

### Keep Building Your Setting

As you’re making stuff up for your characters, you’ll also make stuff up about
the world around them. You’ll end up talking about NPCs, organizations,
places, things like that. That’s fantastic!

You might also come up with a character concept that adds something
fundamental to the world, like saying “I want to play a wizard” when no one
talked about magic yet. When that happens, discuss with the group if that’s a
part of your setting and make any necessary adjustments.

Because picking a high concept and trouble are linked, they’re grouped
together. You’ll likely have more success coming up with a compelling
character idea if you think about them as one big step rather than two
separate steps. Only after you have that (and a name, of course!) can you move
on to the rest of character creation.

That said, don’t worry too much—if your character idea evolves later on,
that’s great! You can always go back and tinker with the early decisions.

### Dials, Dials Everywhere

Fate Core isn’t the be-all and end-all of Fate. It’s just a starting point—a
set of default decisions that will work if you use it as-is.

As you get more familiar with the system, you’ll be tempted to change things
in order to suit your individual game or play style a little bit better.
_That’s totally okay_. These defaults aren’t sacrosanct. It is expected that
you will change them. In fact, throughout this system, the dials will be
pointed out. Another book, the _Fate System Toolkit_, is all about how to
change and configure the Fate system to meet your needs.

So, tweak away.

## High Concept

Your high concept is a phrase that sums up what your character is about—who he
is and what he does. It’s an aspect, one of the first and most important ones
for your character.

Think of this [aspect like your job](../../fate-core/aspects-fate-
points "Aspects & Fate Points" ), your role in life, or your calling—it’s what
you’re good at, but it’s also a duty you have to deal with, and it’s
constantly filled with problems of its own. That is to say, it comes with some
good and some bad. There are a few different directions you can take this:

  * You could take the idea of “like your job” literally: _<span class="aspect">Lead Detective</span>, <span class="aspect">Knight of the Round</span>, <span class="aspect">Low-level Thug</span>_.
  * You could throw on an adjective or other descriptor to further define the idea: _<span class="aspect">Despicable Regent of Riverton</span>, <span class="aspect">Reluctant Lead Detective</span>, <span class="aspect">Ambitious Low-level Thug</span>_.
  * You could mash two jobs or roles together that most people would find odd: _<span class="aspect">Wizard Private Eye, Singing Knight of the Round Table</span>, <span class="aspect">Monster-slaying Accountant</span>_.
  * You could play off of an important relationship to your family or an organization you’re deeply involved with (especially if the family or organization are well-connected or well-known): _<span class="aspect">Black Sheep of the Thompson Family</span>, <span class="aspect">Low-level Thug for the Syndicate</span>, <span class="aspect">Scar Triad’s Patsy in Riverton</span>_.

These aren’t the only ways to play with your high concept, but they’ll get you
started. But don’t stress out over it—the worst thing you can do is make it
into too big of a deal. You’ll come up with four other aspects after this
one—you don’t have to get it all nailed right now.

### If You Get Stumped On Aspects

The golden rule of making aspects in character creation: you can always change
it later. If you’re struggling to make an aspect, write out the idea in as
many words as you need to, in order to get it down on paper in the first
place. If a specific phrase pops up after you write it down, great! If not,
maybe someone else at the table can help you come up with an aspect. And if
you’re still stuck, leave it for now—you’ll have plenty of time during play to
refine it.

And if you really need to, it’s okay to leave some blank. Look at [Quick
Character Creation](../../fate-core/quick-character-creation) for
more on leaving parts of your character sheet blank.

High concepts can have overlap among the characters, as long as you have
something to distinguish how your character is different from the others. If
high concepts must be similar among all the characters, such as if the GM
pitches an all-swordsmen story, it’s crucial that the troubles differ.

> Lenny and Lily settled on the “guy and girl with sword” idea, and Ryan’s
going with “guy without sword.” But those are just starting ideas. Now it’s
time to turn them into proper high concepts.

>

> Lenny latches onto the idea of tying his concept to an organization, and
starts with “Disciple of…something.” He envisions a character who has trained
in some mysterious martial art, and that involves rival schools and foes that
want to learn those secrets. The group helps him come up with a suitably
mysterious name: <span class="aspect">Disciple of the Ivory Shroud</span>. (And now
we’ve made a bit more setting: there’s an Ivory Shroud, mysterious martial
arts, and all that implies.)

>

> Lily, on the other hand, doesn’t really know where to go from “girl with
sword.” She’s not interested in the organization thing, so she’s thinking
about adjectives. Eventually, she settles on <span class="aspect">Infamous Girl with
Sword</span>. (Keeping the “girl with sword” part makes her giggle, so she
wants to say it often during the game.)

>

> Ryan’s idea of “bookish guy without sword” would be a pretty dull aspect. He
thinks about what’s been declared so far: an evil cult who can summon Bad
Things and a mysterious martial arts school. So he asks “hey, can I be a
wizard?” They talk a bit about what that means, so that being a wizard doesn’t
overshadow the swordsmen and isn’t a weak idea. After that, he writes down
<span class="aspect">Wizard for Hire</span>.

## Trouble

In addition to a high concept, every character has some sort of trouble aspect
that’s a part of his life and story. If your high concept is what or who your
character is, your trouble is the answer to a simple question: what
complicates your character’s existence?

Trouble brings chaos into a character’s life and drives him into interesting
situations. Trouble aspects are broken up into two types: **personal
struggles** and **problematic relationships**.

  * **Personal struggles are about your darker side or impulses that are hard to control.** If it’s something that your character might be tempted to do or unconsciously do at the worst possible moment, it’s this sort of trouble. Examples: <span class="aspect">Anger Management Issues</span>, <span class="aspect">Sucker for a Pretty Face</span>,<span class="aspect">The Bottle Calls to Me</span>.
  * **Problematic relationships are about people or organizations that make your life hard.** It could be a group of people who hate your guts and want you to suffer, folks you work for that don’t make your job easy, or even your family or friends that too often get caught in the crossfire. Examples: <span class="aspect">Family Man</span>, <span class="aspect">Debt to the Mob</span>, <span class="aspect">The Scar Triad Wants Me Dead</span>.

Your trouble shouldn’t be easy to solve. If it was, your character would have
done that already, and that’s not interesting. But nor should it paralyze the
character completely. If the trouble is constantly interfering with the
character’s day-to-day life, he’s going to spend all his time dealing with it
rather than other matters at hand. You shouldn’t have to deal with your
trouble at every turn—unless that’s the core of one particular adventure in
the story (and even then, that’s just one adventure).

Troubles also shouldn’t be directly related to your high concept—if you have
Lead Detective, saying your trouble is <span class="aspect">The Criminal Underworld
Hates Me</span> is a dull trouble, because it is already assumed with your
high concept. (Of course, you can turn that up a notch to make it personal,
like <span class="aspect">Don Giovanni Personally Hates Me</span>, to make it work.)

Before you go any further, talk with the GM about your character’s trouble.
Make sure you’re both on the same page in terms of what it means. Both of you
may want to find one way this aspect might be invoked or compelled to make
sure you’re both seeing the same things—or to give each other ideas. The GM
should come away from this conversation knowing what you want out of your
trouble.

> Lenny wants to contrast the whole “I know an ancient martial art” vibe. He’s
not playing an ascetic monk or anything like that. So he wants something that
will get him into social trouble, something that has to do with him and not
with any specific people or organizations. So he writes down <span class="aspect">The
Manners of a Goat</span>. His character will unconsciously make an ass of
himself.

>

> Lily likes this idea of her character being her own worst enemy, so she’s
also going for a personal struggle. She’s had the idea for a while of playing
someone who can’t help but be <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny Things</span>, so
she writes that down.

>

> After seeing the other two go for personal struggles, Ryan wants to add a
bit to the setting by having a problematic relationship trouble. He wants
something that’s involved with his high concept, someone he can’t just fight
openly against—he wants to see intrigue in his story. So he writes down
<span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia Arcana</span> (which also names a group of
people in the setting, that Ryan’s character is a part of).

### The Bright Side of Troubles

Since your trouble is an aspect, it’s something you should also be able to
[invoke](../../fate-core/invoking-compelling-aspects), right? Because
you've been so focused on how this complicates your character’s life, it’s
easy to miss how a trouble also helps your character.

In short, your experience with your trouble makes you a stronger person in
that regard. Dealing with personal struggles leaves you vulnerable to being
tempted or cajoled, but it can also give you a sense of inner strength,
because you know the sort of person you want to be. Problematic relationships
often cause trouble, but people do learn hard lessons from the troubles they
deal with. They especially learn how to maneuver around many of the smaller
issues their troubles present.

Lenny’s <span class="aspect">The Manners of a Goat </span>could be used to the group’s
benefit. Maybe he turns that up intentionally, to draw attention away from
Lily’s character sneaking around.

With Lily’s <span class="aspect">Tempted by Shiny Things</span>, it could reasonably
said that Lily’s character is well-acquainted with the value of various shiny
things (and well-acquainted with getting caught and locked in prison, so she
knows a thing or two about escaping).

Ryan’s <span class="aspect">Rivals in the Collegia Arcana</span> can come in handy
when dealing with rivals he knows well—he knows what to expect from their
tactics. He could also use this aspect to gain aid from people who share his
rivals.

### Intro to Choosing Aspects

A lot of character creation focuses on coming up with aspects—some are called
high concepts, some are called troubles, but they basically all work the same
way. Aspects are one of the most important parts of your character, since they
define who she is, and they provide ways for you to generate fate points and
to spend those fate points on bonuses. If you have time, you really might want
to read the whole section dedicated to aspects before you go through the
process of character creation.

In case you’re pressed for time, here are some guidelines for choosing
aspects.

Aspects which don’t help you tell a good story (by giving you success when you
need it and by drawing you into danger and action when the story needs it)
aren’t doing their job. The aspects which push you into conflict—and help you
excel once you’re there—will be among your best and most-used.

Aspects need to be both useful and dangerous—allowing you to help shape the
story and generating lots of fate points—and they should never be boring. The
best aspect suggests both ways to use it and ways it can complicate your
situation. Aspects that cannot be used for either of those are likely to be
dull indeed.

Bottom line: if you want to maximize the power of your aspects, maximize their
interest.

When you’re told you need to come up with an aspect, you might experience
brain freeze. If you feel stumped for decent ideas for aspects, there’s a big
section focusing on several methods for coming up with good aspect ideas in
[Aspects and Fate Points](../../fate-core/aspects-fate-points).

If your character doesn’t have many connections to the other characters, talk
with the group about aspects that might tie your character in with theirs.
This is the explicit purpose of [Phases Two and Three](../../fate-
core/phase-trio)—but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it elsewhere as well.

If you ultimately can’t break the block by any means, don’t force it—leave it
completely blank. You can always come back and fill out that aspect later, or
let it develop during play—as with the [Quick Character Creation](../../fate-core/quick-character-creation) rules.

Ultimately, it’s much better to leave an aspect slot blank than to pick one
that isn’t inspiring and evocative to play. If you’re picking aspects you’re
not invested in, they’ll end up being noticeable drags on your fun.

## Name

If you haven’t already, it’s time to give your character a name!

> Lenny names his character “Landon,” a name that’s been in his head for
years. He used it years ago for another roleplaying game, and decides to bring
it back for nostalgia’s sake.

>

> Lily names her character “Cynere,” which is Greek for “thistle.” She sees
Cynere as a beautiful plant, but one that’ll prick you if you get too close.
That fits nicely.

>

> Ryan names his character “Zird,” because it just hit his mind as an
appropriately ridiculous wizardly name. Then he pauses for a moment before
adding “…the Arcane,” because he sees Zird as the sort of guy who would demand
to be known as “Zird the Arcane.”
