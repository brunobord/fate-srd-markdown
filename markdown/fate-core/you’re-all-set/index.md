At the end of this process, you should have a character with:

  * A name
  * Five aspects, along with some backstory
  * One Great, two Good, three Fair, and four Average skills
  * Between three and five stunts
  * A mental and physical stress track of 2–4 boxes each

Now you’re ready to play!

GMs, see the [Scenes, Sessions, and Scenarios](../../fate-core
/scenes-sessions-scenarios "Scenes, Sessions, & Scenarios" ) section for
advice on how to take the aspects from the PCs’ sheets and from game creation
and turn those into thrilling scenarios for the players to experience.

Players, check out the next section for more on how to use your aspects, or
