#  Rapport

The Rapport skill is all about making positive connections to people and
eliciting positive emotion. It’s the skill of being liked and trusted.

<span class="fate_font">O</span>**Overcome**: Use Rapport to charm or inspire people
to do what you want, or to establish a good connection with them. Charm your
way past the guard, convince someone to take you into their confidence, or
become the man of the hour at the local tavern. For nameless NPCs, this is
just an overcome action, but you may have to enter a contest to sufficiently
ingratiate yourself to a named NPC or PC.

<span class="fate_font">C</span>**Create an Advantage**: Use Rapport to establish
a positive mood on a target or in a scene or to get someone to confide in you
out of a genuine sense of trust. You could pep talk someone into having
Elevated Confidence, or stir a crowd into a <span class="aspect">Joyful Fervor</span>,
or simply make someone <span class="aspect">Talkative</span> or
<span class="aspect">Helpful</span>.

<span class="fate_font">A</span>**Attack**: Rapport doesn’t cause harm, so you don’t
use it for attacks.

<span class="fate_font">D</span>**Defend**: Rapport defends against any skill used to
damage your reputation, sour a mood you’ve created, or make you look bad in
front of other people. It does not, however, defend against mental attacks.
That requires [Will](../../fate-core/will).

## Rapport Stunts

  * **Best Foot Forward**. Twice per session, you may upgrade a boost you receive with Rapport into a full situation aspect with a free invocation.
  * **Demagogue**. +2 to Rapport when you’re delivering an inspiring speech in front of a crowd. (If there are named NPCs or PCs in the scene, you may target them all simultaneously with one roll rather than dividing up your shifts.)
  * **Popular**. If you’re in an area where you’re popular and well-liked, you can use Rapport in place of Contacts. You may be able to establish your popularity by spending a fate point to declare a story detail, or because of prior justification.
