#  What You Need To Play

Getting into a game of Fate is very simple. You need:

  * **Between three and five people.** One of you is going to be the gamemaster (or “GM” for short), and everyone else is going to be a player.
  * **A character sheet, one per player, and some extra paper for note-taking.** (GMs, any important characters you play might have a character sheet also.)
  * **Fate dice, at least four, preferably four per person.** Fate dice are a special kind of six-sided dice that are marked on two sides with a plus symbol (<span class="fate_font">+</span>), two with a minus symbol (<span class="fate_font">-</span>), and two sides are blank (<span class="fate_font">0</span>). You can get these dice from many hobby and game stores, often under their original name, Fudge dice. (For Fate’s purposes we’ll continue to call them Fate dice, but call them whatever you like!) Fate dice can be purchased at your friendly local game shop or [online](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-dice/ "Buy dice from Evil Hat" ).

### Alternatives to Fate Dice

The Deck of Fate is an alternative to Fate dice that will be available from
Evil Hat. It’s a deck of cards that mimics the probability of Fate dice, and
is designed to be used in the same way Fate dice are.

If you don’t want to use Fate dice, you don’t have to—any set of regular six-
sided dice will work. If you’re using regular dice, you read 5 or 6 as
<span class="fate_font">+</span>, 1 or 2 as <span class="fate_font">-</span>, and 3 or 4 as
<span class="fate_font">0</span>.

  * **Tokens to represent [fate points](../../fate-core/fate-points "Fate Points" )**. Poker chips, glass beads, or anything similar will work. You’ll want to have at least thirty or more of these on hand, just to make sure you have enough for any given game. You can use pencil marks on your character sheet in lieu of tokens, but physical tokens add a little more fun.
  * **Index cards.** These are optional, but they’re very handy for recording [aspects](../../fate-core/types-aspects "Aspects" ) during play.
