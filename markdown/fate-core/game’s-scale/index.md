#  A Game’s Scale

## Decide how epic or personal your story will be.

The setting might be small or it might be vast, but where your stories take
place determines the scale of your game.

In a small-scale game, characters deal with problems in a city or region, they
don’t travel a great deal, and the problems are local. A large-scale game
involves dealing with problems that affect a world, a civilization, or even a
galaxy if the genre you’re playing in can handle that kind of thing.
(Sometimes, a small-scale game will turn into a large-scale one over time, as
you’ve probably seen in long-running novel series or television shows.)

> Amanda likes the vibe of “guy and girl with sword,” and thinks it’ll shine
as a small-scale game, where they might travel from town to town, but the
problems they have to deal with are local—like a thieves’ guild or the
regent’s vile machinations.
