#  Scenes, Sessions, &amp; Scenarios

By now, you and your group have created the PCs, established the world they
inhabit, and set all the basic assumptions for the game you’re going to play.
Now you have a pile of aspects and NPCs, brimming with dramatic potential and
waiting to come to life.

What do you do with them?

It’s time to get into the real meat of the game: creating and playing through
scenarios.
