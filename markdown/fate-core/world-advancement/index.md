#  World Advancement

The characters are not the only ones who change in response to events in the
game. Player characters leave their mark on locations (and their faces) with
their passing. Things that were crises and major issues at the start of a game
get addressed, resolved, or changed. Things that weren’t major problems before
suddenly blossom with new severity and life. Old adversaries fall to the
wayside and new ones rise.

GMs, when the players are changing their characters through milestones, you
should also be looking at whether or not the aspects you originally placed on
the game during game creation need to change in response to what they’ve done,
or simply because of lack of use.

Here are some guidelines regarding each milestone.

## For Minor Milestones

  * Do you need to add a new location to the game, based on what the PCs have done? If so, come up with some NPCs to help give more personality to the location and add an issue to the place.
  * Have the PCs resolved an issue in a location? Get rid of the aspect, or maybe change it to represent how the issue was resolved (<span class="aspect">In the Shadow of the Necromancer</span> becomes <span class="aspect">Memories of Tyranny</span>, for example).

> The group reaches a minor milestone because they rescued the Lord of
Varendep’s son from some of the Smuggler Queen Barathar’s minions. It was a
small victory that could pay some pretty nice dividends because they now have
an ally in Lord Bornhold of Varendep.

>

> Amanda thinks about what might change as a result of the group’s victory.
She doesn’t need to add a new location, but she thinks that Barathar might
have a grudge against Varendep for getting out from under her thumb now that
their Lord’s son has been rescued. She decides to change Varendep’s issue of
<span class="aspect">Secret Fealty to the Smuggler Queen</span> to <span class="aspect">At War
with Barathar</span> to represent the shifting power dynamic, as well as Lord
Bornhold’s willingness to stand up to her now.

## For Significant Milestones

  * Did the PCs resolve an issue that was on the whole game world? If so, remove (or alter) the aspect.
  * Did the PCs create permanent change in a location? If so, create a new issue to reflect this, for better or for worse.

> Later, the group drives Barathar’s lieutenant, Hollister, back out of the
Sindral Reach. Barathar is still a threat, but her power is significantly
diminished; this is a major victory for the party. Cynere skewered Hollister
in single combat, so he’s no longer a threat at all; this resolves a world-
wide issue, <span class="aspect">Everybody Fears Hollister</span>, so Amanda crosses
it off. She’s not quite sure what to replace it with yet, so she’ll think
about it for a bit.

>

> They also created permanent change in the Sindral Reach; that area of the
world is no longer under Barathar’s sway. Most of the people are grateful, but
a few of Barathar’s thugs remain to make trouble for the party. Amanda
replaces the issue <span class="aspect">Seat of Barathar’s Power</span> with a
different one, <span class="aspect">Smiles in the Open, Knives in the Dark</span> to
represent how things have changed.

## For Major Milestones

  * Did the PCs create permanent change in the game world? If so, give it a new issue to reflect this, for better or for worse.

> Finally, the heroes confront and defeat Barathar in an epic confrontation.
Barathar held a lot of power in the underground throughout the world and her
defeat will cause ripples. Someone’s going to want to step in and take her
place (probably a lot of someones), so Amanda creates the issue
<span class="aspect">Underworld Power Vacuum</span> to reflect this.

You don’t need to make these changes as precisely or as regularly as the
players do—if anything, you should be as reactive as you can. In other words,
focus on changing those aspects that the player characters have directly
interacted with and caused the most change to.

If you have aspects you haven’t really explored yet, keep them around if you
think they’re just waiting their turn. However, you can also change them in
order to make them more relevant to what’s going on in the moment, or simply
to give the PCs more of a sense of being in an evolving world.

> Barathar wasn’t the only game in town. The Skull-King lurks in the north,
and Lord Wynthrep is stirring up war in the east. Amanda likes the idea of the
PCs facing down a powerful necromancer in the near future, so she decides to
keep the issueDarkness Creeps from the North in place.

>

> The other issue, <span class="aspect">Saber-Rattling in the East</span> is also
interesting, but she thinks that all this confrontation with the Smuggler
Queen probably gave Lord Wynthrep the opportunity he needed to escalate
things. She changes <span class="aspect">Saber-Rattling in the East</span> to
<span class="aspect">The East at War!</span>. That should give the PCs an interesting
decision to make.

Also, keep in mind that if the PCs remove an impending issue, another one must
arise to take its place. Don’t worry about this immediately—you need to give
your players a sense of enacting permanent change in the game world. But after
a while, if you notice that you’re low on impending issues, it’s probably a
good time to introduce a new one, whether on the game world as a whole or on a
specific location.

## Dealing with NPCs

Remember, GMs, when you add a new location to the game world, you want to add
at least one new NPC to go with it. Sometimes, that might mean moving a person
from a location you’re not going to use anymore.

Likewise, when there’s a significant change in an issue for a location or the
game world, you need to evaluate if the current NPCs are sufficient to express
that change. If not, you might need to add one, or alter an NPC you have in a
significant way—add more aspects or revise existing aspects to keep that
character relevant to the issue at hand.

Most of the time, it should be pretty obvious when you need a new face for a
location—when the old one dies or is somehow permanently removed from the
game, or is boring now, it’s probably time to change things up.

> When the heroes rescued Lord Bornhold’s son, Carris, from the Smuggler
Queen, Lord Bornhold became indebted to them. To reflect this, Amanda changed
a few of his aspects to make him more friendly to the PCs and less subservient
to Barathar.

>

> When Barathar was defeated, Amanda figured she needed someone to step in and
take over the underworld. Carris and Barathar had become lovers during
Carris’s captivity, and he’s not happy about her death. He’s so unhappy, in
fact, that he decides to take her place and become the Smuggler King of the
Sindral Reach. Because he’s vowed to retake the underworld in Barathar’s name
(and because Amanda didn’t have any stats prepared for Carris), Amanda writes
up new NPC stats for Carris and turns him into a brand new villain for the PCs
to confront. This one could get a bit sticky!

## Recurring NPCs

There are essentially two ways to reuse NPCs. You can either use them to show
how the PCs have grown since they started, or use them to show how the world
is responding to their growth.

With the former, you don’t change the NPC, because that’s the point—the next
time the PCs meet them, they’ve outclassed them, or they have new worries, or
they’ve somehow grown past that NPC, who remains static. Maybe you even change
the category they’re in—where they were once a main NPC, now they’re a
supporting NPC because of how the PCs have grown.

With the latter, you allow the NPC to advance like the PCs have—you add new
skills, change their aspects around, give them a stunt or two, and otherwise
do whatever is necessary to keep them relevant to the PCs’ endeavors. This
kind of NPC might be able to hang around as a nemesis for several story arcs,
or at least provide some sense of continuity as the PCs become more powerful
and influential.

> Barathar advanced right along with the PCs. She was a main villain and
Amanda wanted to keep her relevant and challenging right up until they
defeated her, so every time the PCs got a milestone, she applied the same
effects to Barathar. She also made minor tweaks here and there (changing
aspects, swapping skills) to react to what the PCs did in the world throughout
their adventures.

>

> Sir Hanley, the knight who tried to prevent them from entering Varendep when
they first got there, was pretty challenging when they first confronted him.
He was a major NPC, and the fight was meant to be the culmination of an entire
session. They got past him, convincing him to let them in, so he became less
relevant after that. He was resentful and got in their way a few times, but he
didn’t advance as they did so the PCs quickly outclassed him. The last time
they had a run-in with Sir Hanley, they spanked him pretty hard and sent him
running off to lick his wounds.
