#  Drive

The Drive skill is all about operating vehicles and things that go fast.

Like [Crafts](../../fate-core/crafts), how the Drive skill appears in
your games is going to depend a lot on how much action you intend to have
inside of vehicles or other forms of transportation, and what kind of
technology is available in your setting.

For example, a low-tech setting (like Hearts of Steel) might have Ride instead
of Drive, because the main transportation is animal-based. A futuristic
setting revolving around people in a space opera military might have Drive
(for cars), Pilot (for starships), and Operate (for tanks or heavy military
vehicles).

### Different Vehicles, Different Skills

The advice is the same as for Crafts—don’t go nuts with reskinning this skill
unless it makes a real, tangible difference in your game. Especially consider
the option of having one skill that’s modified by stunts (see [Building Stunts
](../../fate-core/building-stunts)).

<span class="fate_font">O</span>**Overcome**: Drive is the equivalent of [Athletics
](../../fate-core/athletics) when you’re in a vehicle—you use it to
successfully accomplish movement in the face of difficult circumstances, like
rough terrain, small amounts of clearance, or stunt driving. Obviously, Drive
is also ripe for contests, especially chases and races.

<span class="fate_font">C</span>**Create an Advantage**: You can use Drive to
determine the best way to get somewhere in a vehicle, and a good enough roll
might allow you to learn features of the route that get expressed as aspects,
or declare that you know a Convenient Shortcut or something similar.

You can also just read the Athletics description, and then make it about a
vehicle. Advantages created using Drive often revolve around getting good
positioning, doing a fancy maneuver (Did a Barrel Roll, anyone?), or putting
your opponent in a bad spot.

<span class="fate_font">A</span>**Attack**: Drive isn’t usually used as an attack
skill (though stunts can certainly alter this). If you want to ram a vehicle,
you can attack with Drive, but you take the same shifts of harm you inflict.

<span class="fate_font">D</span>**Defend**: Avoiding damage to a vehicle in a physical
conflict is one of the most common uses of Drive. You can also use it to
defend against advantages being created against you or overcome actions of
someone trying to move past you in a vehicle.

## Drive Stunts

  * **Hard to Shake**. +2 to Drive whenever you’re pursuing another vehicle in a chase scene.
  * **Pedal to the Metal**. You can coax more speed out of your vehicle than seems possible. Whenever you’re engaged in any contest where speed is the primary factor (such as a chase or race of some kind) and you tie with your Drive roll, it’s considered a success.
  * **Ramming Speed!** When ramming another vehicle, you ignore two shifts of damage. So if you ram and hit for four shifts, you only take two yourself.
