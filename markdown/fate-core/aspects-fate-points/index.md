#  Aspects &amp; Fate Points

## Defining Aspects

An aspect is a phrase that describes something unique or noteworthy about
whatever it’s attached to. They’re the primary way you spend and gain fate
points, and they influence the story by providing an opportunity for a
character to get a bonus, complicating a character’s life, or adding to
another character’s roll or passive opposition.

## Defining Fate Points

GMs and players, you both have a pool of points called [fate points](../../fate-core/fate-points "Fate Points" ) you can use to influence the
game. You represent these with tokens, as we mentioned in The Basics. Players,
you start with a certain number of points every scenario, equal to your
character’s refresh. You’ll also reset to your refresh rate if you ended a
mid-scenario session with fewer fate points than your rate. GMs, [you get a
budget of fate points](../../fate-core/fate-point-economy "Fate Point
Economy" ) to spend in every scene.

When your aspects come into play, you will usually spend or gain a fate point.
