#  Athletics

The Athletics skill represents your character’s general level of physical
fitness, whether through training, natural gifts, or genre-specific means
(like magic or genetic alteration). It’s how good you are at moving your body.
As such, it is a popular choice for nearly any action-y character.

Athletics is all but ubiquitous among every genre appropriate for Fate—it
would only be unnecessary in a game that focused exclusively on interpersonal
interaction and had no physical conflict.

<span class="fate_font">O</span>**Overcome:** Athletics allows you to overcome any
obstacle that requires physical movement—jumping, running, climbing, swimming,
etc. If it resembles something you’d do in the decathlon, you roll Athletics.
You use overcome actions with Athletics to move between zones in a conflict if
there’s a situation aspect or other obstacle in your way. You also roll
Athletics to chase or race in any contests or challenges that rely on these
types of activities.

<span class="fate_font">C</span>**Create an Advantage:** When you’re creating an
advantage with Athletics, you’re jumping to high ground, running faster than
the opponent can keep up with, or performing dazzling acrobatic maneuvers in
order to confound your foes.

<span class="fate_font">A</span>**Attack:** Athletics is not meant as an attack skill.

<span class="fate_font">D</span>**Defend:** Athletics is a catch-all skill to roll for
defense in a physical conflict, against close-quarters and ranged attacks. You
can also use it to defend against characters trying to move past you, if
you’re in a position to physically interfere with whoever’s making the
attempt.

You might decide that Athletics is inappropriate for defense against firearms
or other high-tech ranged weapons in your setting. There really isn’t any
other skill that defends against them, though. If you make this decision, it
will make those weapons very, very dangerous. Or have another skill defend
against them.

## Athletics Stunts

  * **Sprinter**. You move two zones for free in a conflict without rolling, instead of one, provided there are no situation aspects restricting movement.
  * **Hardcore Parkour**. +2 to overcome actions with Athletics if you are in a chase across rooftops or a similarly precarious environment.
  * **Dazing Counter**. When you succeed with style on a defend action against an opponent’s Fight roll, you automatically counter with some sort of nerve punch or stunning blow. You get to attach the Dazed situation aspect to your opponent with a free invoke, instead of just a boost.
