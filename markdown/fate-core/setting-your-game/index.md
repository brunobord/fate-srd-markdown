## Setting Up Your Game

The first step in setting up your Fate game is to decide what sort of people
the protagonists are and what sort of world surrounds them. Your decisions
here will tell you virtually everything you need to know to get the ball
rolling: what the protagonists are good at, what they may or may not care
about, what problems they’re likely to get into, what kind of impact these
characters have on the world, and so on. You don’t need complete answers
(because that’s part of the point of playing the game), but you should have
enough of an idea that answering those questions doesn’t draw a blank.

First, we’ll start by talking about your setting. We’ll handle the specifics
on the protagonists later, in [Character Creation](../../fate-core
/character-creation "Character Creation" ).
