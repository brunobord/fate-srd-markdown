#  Shoot

The counterpart to [Fight](../../fate-core/fight), Shoot is the skill
of using ranged weaponry, either in a conflict or on targets that don’t
actively resist your attempts to shoot them (like a bull’s-eye or the broad
side of a barn).

Again, as with Fight, if it’s important to your setting to make a distinction
between different types of ranged weaponry, you might separate this out into
skills like Bows, Guns, Energy Weapons, etc. Don’t go nuts with this unless
it’s key to your game.

<span class="fate_font">O</span>**Overcome**: Unless, for some reason, you need to
demonstrate your Shoot ability in a non-conflict situation, you probably won’t
be using this skill for normal obstacles much. Obviously, contests involving
Shoot are a popular staple of adventure fiction, and we recommend you look for
the opportunity to have them if you have a character who specializes in this.

<span class="fate_font">C</span>**Create an Advantage**: In physical conflicts,
Shoot can be used to perform a wide variety of moves, like trick shots,
keeping someone under heavy fire, and the like. In cinematic games, you might
even be able to disarm people and pin their sleeves to walls—pretty much
anything you’ve seen in an action movie. You could also make the argument for
creating aspects based on your knowledge of guns (like placing a
<span class="aspect">Prone to Jams</span> aspect on an opponent’s gun).

<span class="fate_font">A</span>**Attack**: This skill makes physical attacks. You can
make them from up to two zones away, unlike with Fight. (Sometimes the range
will change with the weapon.)

<span class="fate_font">D</span>**Defend**: Shoot is unique in that it doesn’t really
have a defense component to it—you’d use Athletics for that. You could use it
to lay down some covering fire—which might act as a defense for your allies or
provide opposition to someone else’s movement—though it could just as easily
be represented by creating an advantage (<span class="aspect">Covering Fire</span> or
<span class="aspect">Hail of Bullets</span>, for example).

## Shoot Stunts

  * **Called Shot**. During a Shoot attack, spend a fate point and declare a specific condition you want to inflict on a target, like Shot in the Hand. If you succeed, you place that as a situation aspect on them in addition to hitting them for stress.
  * **Quick on the Draw**. You can use Shoot instead of Notice to determine turn order in any physical conflict where shooting quickly would be useful.
  * **Uncanny Accuracy**. Once per conflict, stack an additional free invoke on an advantage you’ve created to represent the time you take to aim or line up a shot (like In My Sights).
