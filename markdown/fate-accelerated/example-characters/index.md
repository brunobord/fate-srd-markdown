#  Example Characters

Here are four sample characters that you can use as-is or use as inspiration
for your own characters.

## Reth of the Andrali Resistance

Reth is 14 years of age. He has dark brown skin and dark hair that he wears in
thick dreadlocks. He wears light, loose-fitting clothing and sandals, and he’s
a skilled martial artist. He’s the most powerful Suncaller to be born in
generations; he can magically call forth the power of fire. Originally from a
town in the vast Andral Desert, he and his friends took a stand against the
invading Steel Empire and have been living on the run since.
