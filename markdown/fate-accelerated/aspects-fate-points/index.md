#  Aspects &amp; Fate Points

An **aspect** is a word or phrase that describes something special about a
person, place, thing, situation, or group. Almost anything you can think of
can have aspects. A person might be the <span class="aspect">Greatest Swordswoman on
the Cloud Sea</span>. A room might be <span class="aspect">On Fire</span> after you
knock over an oil lamp. After a time-travel encounter with a dinosaur, you
might be <span class="aspect">Terrified</span>. Aspects let you change the story in
ways that go along with your character’s tendencies, skills, or problems.

You **spend fate points**—which you keep track of with pennies or glass beads
or poker chips or some other tokens—to unlock the power of aspects and make
them help you. You **earn** fate points by letting a character aspect be
compelled against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder. Be
sure to keep track of the fate points you have left at the end of the
session—if you have [more than your refresh](../../fate-accelerated
/who-do-you-want-be "Who Do You Want To Be?" ), you start the next session
with the fate points you ended this session with.

> You earned a lot of fate points during your game session, ending the day
with five fate points. Your refresh is 2, so you’ll start with five fate
points the next time you play. But another player ends the same session with
just one fate point. His refresh is 3, so he’ll begin the next session with 3
fate points, not just the one he had left over.

## What Kinds of Aspects Are There?

There’s an endless variety of aspects, but no matter what they’re called they
all work pretty much the same way. The main difference is how long they stick
around before going away.

**Character Aspects**: These aspects are on your character sheet, such as your [high concept](../../fate-accelerated/who-do-you-want-be) and [trouble](../../fate-accelerated/who-do-you-want-be). They describe personality traits, important details about your past, relationships you have with others, important items or titles you possess, problems you’re dealing with or goals you’re working toward, or reputations and obligations you carry. These aspects only change under very unusual circumstances; most never will.

**Examples**: <span class="aspect">Captain of the Skyship Nimbus</span>; <span class="aspect">On the Run From the Knights of the Circle</span>; <span class="aspect">Attention to Detail</span>; <span class="aspect">I Must Protect My Brother</span>

**Situation Aspects**: These aspects describe the surroundings that the action is taking place in. This includes aspects you create or discover using the create an advantage action. A situation aspect usually vanishes at the end of the scene it was part of, or when someone takes some action that would change or get rid of it. Essentially, they last only as long as the situational element they represent lasts.

**Examples**: <span class="aspect">On Fire</span>; <span class="aspect">Bright Sunlight</span>; <span class="aspect">Crowd of Angry People</span>; <span class="aspect">Knocked to the Ground</span>

To get rid of a situation aspect, you can attempt an overcome action to
eliminate it, provided you can think of a way your character could accomplish
it—dump a bucket of water on the Raging Fire, use evasive maneuvers to escape
the enemy fighter that’s On Your Tail. An opponent may use a Defend action to
try to preserve the aspect, if they can describe how they do it.

**Consequences**: These aspects represent injuries or other lasting trauma that happen when you get hit by attacks. They go away slowly, as described in [Ouch! Damage, Stress, and Consequences](../../fate-accelerated/ouch-damage-stress-and-consequences "Damage, Stress, & Consequences" ).

**Examples**: <span class="aspect">Sprained Ankle</span>; <span class="aspect">Fear of Spiders</span>; <span class="aspect">Concussion</span>; <span class="aspect">Debilitating Self-Doubt</span>

**Boosts**: A boost is a temporary aspect that you get to use once (see “What Do You Do With Aspects?”next), then it vanishes. Unused boosts vanish when the scene they were created in is over or when the advantage they represent no longer exists. These represent very brief and fleeting advantages you get in conflicts with others.

**Examples**: <span class="aspect">In My Sights</span>; <span class="aspect">Distracted</span>; <span class="aspect">Unstable Footing</span>; <span class="aspect">Rock in His Boot</span>

### PVP (Player versus player)

The only time that fate point might not go to the GM is when you’re in
conflict with another player. If you are, and you invoke one of that player’s
character aspects to help you out against them, they will get the fate point
instead of the GM once the scene is over.

## What Do You Do With Aspects?

There are three big things you can do with aspects: **invoke** aspects,
**compel** aspects, and use aspects to **establish facts**.

### Invoking Aspects

You invoke an aspect to give yourself a bonus or make things a bit harder for
your opponent. You can invoke any aspect that you a) know about, and b) can
explain how you use it to your advantage—including aspects on other characters
or on the situation. Normally, invoking an aspect costs you a fate point—hand
one of your fate points to the GM. To invoke an aspect, you need to describe
how that aspect helps you in your current situation.

>   * I attack the zombie with my sword. I know zombies are
<span class="aspect">Sluggish</span>, so that should help me.

>   * I really want to scare this guy. I’ve heard he’s <span class="aspect">Scared of
Mice</span>, so I’ll release a mouse in his bedroom.

>   * Now that the guard’s <span class="aspect">Distracted</span>, I should be able to
sneak right by him.

>   * This spell needs to be really powerful—I’m an <span class="aspect">Archwizard of
the Ancient Order</span>, and powerful spells are my bread and butter.

>

What does invoking the aspect get you? Choose one of the following effects:

  * **Add a +2 bonus to your total.** This costs a fate point.
  * **Reroll the dice.** This option is best if you rolled really lousy (usually a −3 or −4 showing on the dice). This costs a fate point.
  * **Confront an opponent with the aspect.** You use this option when your opponent is trying something and you think an existing aspect would make it harder for them. For instance, an alien thug wants to draw his blaster pistol, but he’s <span class="aspect">Buried in Debris</span>; you spend a fate point to invoke that aspect, and now your opponent’s level of difficulty is increased by +2.
  * **Help an ally with the aspect.** Use this option when a friend could use some help and you think an existing aspect would make it easier for them. You spend a fate point to invoke the aspect, and now your friend gets a +2 on their roll.

**Important**: You can only invoke any aspect once on a given dice roll; you can’t spend a stack of fate points on one aspect and get a huge bonus from it. However, you can invoke several different aspects on the same roll.

If you’re invoking an aspect to add a bonus or reroll your dice, wait until
after you’ve rolled to do it. No sense spending a fate point if you don’t need
to!

**Free invocations**: [Sometimes you can invoke an aspect for free](../../fate-accelerated/how-do-stuff-outcomes-actions-and-approaches "Outcomes, Actions, & Approaches" ), without paying a fate point. If you create or discover an aspect through the create an advantage action, the first invocation on it (by you or an ally) is free (if you succeeded with style, you get two freebies). If you cause a consequence through an attack, you or an ally can invoke it once for free. A [boost](../../fate-accelerated/aspects-fate-points "Aspects & Fate Points" ) is a special kind of aspect that grants one free invocation, then it vanishes.

### Compelling Aspects

If you’re in a situation where having or being around a certain aspect means
your character’s life is more dramatic or complicated, anyone can compel the
aspect. You can even compel it on yourself—that’s called a self-compel.
Compels are the most common way for players to earn more fate points.

There are two types of compels.

**Decision compels**: This sort of compel suggests the answer to a decision your character has to make. If your character is <span class="aspect">Princess of Alaria</span>, for example, you may need to stay to lead the defense of the Royal Alarian Castle rather than fleeing to safety. Or if you have a <span class="aspect">Defiant Streak a Mile Wide</span>, maybe you can’t help but mouth off to the Dean of Discipline when he questions you.

**Event compels**: Other times a compel reflects something happening that makes life more complicated for you. If you have <span class="aspect">Strange Luck</span>, of course that spell you’re working on in class accidentally turns the dour Potions Master’s hair orange. If you <span class="aspect">Owe Don Valdeon a Favor</span>, then Don Valdeon shows up and demands that you perform a service for him just when it’s least convenient.

In any case, when an aspect is compelled against you, the person compelling it
offers you a fate point and suggests that the aspect has a certain effect—that
you’ll make a certain decision or that a particular event will occur. You can
discuss it back and forth, proposing tweaks or changes to the suggested
compel. After a moment or two, you need to decide whether to accept the
compel. If you agree, you take the fate point and your character makes the
suggested decision or the event happens. If you refuse, you must pay a fate
point from your own supply. Yes, this means that if you don’t have any fate
points, you can’t refuse a compel!

### How Many Fate Points Does the GM Get?

As GM, you don’t need to track fate points for each NPC, but that doesn’t mean
you get an unlimited number. Start each scene with a pool of one fate point
per PC that’s in the scene. Spend fate points from this pool to invoke aspects
(and consequences) against the PCs. When it’s empty, you can’t invoke aspects
against them.

How can you increase the size of your pool? When a player compels one of an
NPC’s aspects, add the fate point to your pool. If that compel ends the scene,
or when an NPC gives in, instead add those fate points to your pool at the
start of the next scene.

Fate points you award for compels do NOT come from this pool. You never have
to worry about running out of fate points to award for compels.

### Establishing Facts

The final thing that aspects can do is **establish facts** in the game. You
don’t have to spend any fate points, roll dice, or anything to make this
happen—just by virtue of having the aspect <span class="aspect">Ruddy Duck’s
Pilot</span>, you’ve established that your character is a pilot and that you
fly a plane named the Ruddy Duck. Having the aspect <span class="aspect">Mortal Enemy:
The Red Ninjas</span> establishes that the setting has an organization called
the Red Ninjas and that they’re after you for some reason. If you take the
aspect <span class="aspect">Sorcerer of the Mysterious Circle</span>, you not only
establish that there’s a group of sorcerers called the Mysterious Circle, but
that magic exists in the setting and that you can perform it.

When you establish facts of the setting this way, make sure you do it in
cooperation with other players. If most people want to play in a setting
without magic, you shouldn’t unilaterally bring magic into it through an
aspect. Make sure that the facts you establish through your aspects make the
game fun for everyone.

## Composing Good Aspects

When you need to think of a good aspect (we’re mainly talking about character
and situation aspects here), think about two things:

  * How the aspect might help you—when you’d invoke it.
  * How it might hurt you—when it would be compelled against you.

For example:

<span class="aspect">_I’ll Get You, von Stendahl!_</span>

  * Invoke this when acting against von Stendahl to improve your chances.
  * Get a fate point when your dislike for von Stendahl makes you do something foolish to try to get him.

<span class="aspect">_Hair Trigger Nerves_</span>

  * Invoke this when being extra vigilant and careful would help you.
  * Get a fate point when this causes you to be jumpy and be distracted by threats that aren’t really there.

Obviously, your trouble aspect is supposed to cause problems—and thereby make
your character’s life more interesting and get you fate points—so it’s okay if
that one’s a little more one-dimensional, but other character and situation
aspects should be double-edged.
